What should Bitcoin be like, in the future?

These six ideas comprise (what I call) the "sidechain vision".

Few will resist any single idea, in isolation. But rarely will someone endorse all six simultaneously...

...at least, so far!

Here they are:


<h3 id="1">Bitcoin must ossify.</h3>

* Every change is an attack vector.[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5]
* Previous changes have introduced harmful/controversial elements, even via soft fork:
	- The 4 MB blocksize increase[^6] in 2017.
	- The SegWit-input perverse incentive[^7] (also 2017).
* If the protocol is frozen, then users can learn Bitcoin, via firsthand experience. They do not need to be coders (just as we use electricity without being electricians).

[^7]: P2WPKH-SegWit inputs are 1 byte larger [148.5, vs 147.5](https://medium.com/coinmonks/on-bitcoin-transaction-sizes-part-2-9445373d17f4#7f9a), but are charged as if they had 80 or so *fewer* bytes. And, with P2SH-SegWit the problem is far worse. SegWit does save a paltry 3 output-bytes (which is irrelevant compared to the enormous 79 byte undercharge), relative to P2PKH, but P2PKH could also save these exact bytes, by simply making use of additional txn version numbers (of which there are 4.3 billion unused... so, plenty to spare).


<h3 id="2">2. The blocksize must shrink.</h3>

* See Luke Dashjr's argument[^8] for shrinking the blocksize. 
* If users transact on Layer2s, then 0.2 MB blocks [ie, 36,000 txn/day] for layer1 is already overkill.[^9] [^11] [^10]

[^8]: Luke-Jr; May 2019; ["Briefly, Why Blocksizes Shouldn't Be Too Big"](https://youtu.be/JJF5Gnro1GU?t=393). At 16:09, Luke says "It may be already too late... we should have reduced the blocksize years ago." If it was too late *then* [mid 2019], then it is certainly too late now [mid 2022].

<h3 id="3">3. Fee Revenues must rise.</h3>

* Fees are stubbornly low.[^12] [^13]
* As the subsidy wanes, total security budget will leave the network vulnerable to attack.[^12] [^13] [^15]
* Merged Mining is both necessary[^12] and sufficient[^14] for effective Fee Revenues.

<h3 id="4">4. Bitcoin must become interoperable (ie, "MultiChain").</h3>

* Today, in any protocol dispute, one group must leave disappointed. (Ie, blocks cannot be *both* large and small.) But: an idea can still be good, even if it is inferior. (Ie, coach class seats can still be profitable, even if the airline relies primarily on First Class.[^16])
* A protocol with willing miners, devs, and users, will exist. If not as a BTC-sidechain, then it will exist as an Altcoin. These Alts "sneak"[^17] around the 21M coin limit, and threaten the network effects[^18] that BTC needs to survive. But with sidechains, the Altcoin-justification argument is reversed: there is no story an Altcoiner could tell, that an investor would accept.
* The "MultiChain Bitcoin" idea is very old[^19] [^20], and technical opposition to present-day sidechain-tech is unfounded[^21].
* On Ethereum alone, there is already over 275,000 "wrapped BTC". Bitcoin will become multichain, *on* Altcoins if not on Bitcoin.
* Choice isn't just efficient - choice is a moral issue.[^22] [^23]

<h3 id="5">5. Lightning isn't enough.</h3>

* It would take over 120 years to onboard 8 billion people to the LN.[^24] LN cannot be the only scaling solution. Some senior LN Developers argue this in public.[^26]
* The onboarding problem has two solutions --CTV and channel factories-- but each is unreliable. Each can be DoS attacked, for free, thus consuming many more bytes (hence *reducing* the onboarding rate further, not increasing it).[^24]
* LN is inappropriate for many use-cases.[^16] [^25] Other Layer2s are needed, sidechains in particular.

[^26]: Tadge Dryja; Apr 2019; ["Limitations of the Lightning Network"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnG5H62I7Ko); (27:50) "So, yeah: increase the blocksize ... (or some kind of extension block, who knows), these [scaling solutions] *all* have to happen in concert...and I think that most of the Core Developers have said that...It's weird...it became this polarized thing". (43:20) Peter: "This isn't the call I expected...I expected a very pro-lightning [talk]", Tadge: "... I've seen, like, a tribal ... everyone's like: 'LN is the gonna be the best thing ever' -- wait, uh, it [LN] can't actually do that. ... It's a part of a scaling solution, but I think there's other stuff."



<h3 id="6">6. Bitcoin Development needs Competition.</h3>

* The Bitcoin Core Development process utilizes *deliberation*. But deliberation is inferior to competition. Especially in fields where so much is happening. Review cannot keep up; it is too much for any individual or group to manage, USSR-style. We need institutionalized opposition.[^27]
* By design, Core will reject good-but-controversial ideas.[^28] Thus, today's protocol is sub-optimal.
* Most new ideas do not engage with Core, they instead launch as Altcoins.[^33]
* Core helps devs enhance their careers/reputation; but the end user is neglected.[^32] This is immoral.
* Soft forks now take years.[^30] (Meanwhile, the damage done by the overlarge Blocksize is already being done[^8], each day.)
* The "activation" process is based on informed consent, which doesn't exist.[^29] Most SegWit supporters did not understand SegWit; and most Drivechain supporters do not understand DC. This is normal and healthy.[^31]



[^27]: Specifically, there need to be people who benefit from the downfall of the current leadership (aka Wladimir), *without* this harming regular users. This is the only way to ensure that the review process is rational. See ["Her majesty's loyal opposition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Loyal_Opposition_%28United_Kingdom%29).
[^28]: There is intentionally a ["gap"](https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1523349241879425025) between what Core works on, and what is best for the Bitcoin user.
[^29]: The variety of views, even within the Bitcoin Orthodoxy, is extreme. See this [controversy about Taproot pubkeys](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1522283651085574149) or Luke-Jr's belief that [everyone MUST run the exact same software](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1523352520692625408) (which, among other things, means that EVERY Bitcoin user MUST [1] participate in Bitcoin development, [2] always switch their software to the latest version released "by Core", etc).

[^31]: F.A. Hayek (invoking A. Whitehead); Sep 1945; ["The Use of Knowledge in Society":"...without thinking about them."](https://fee.org/articles/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/#:~:text=%22It%20is%20a,thinking%20about%20them.%22)
[^32]: Udi Wertheimer; May/Jun 2022; ["when are we going to have an honest conversation about how taproot was a complete failure"](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1529563243856990209), ["the plot twist is it doesn't do anything and no one wants it"](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1532507243777867776), and [this graph](https://transactionfee.info/charts/transactions-spending-taproot/).
[^33]: First, this is often attributed to BTC's superior quality control. Supposedly, BTC allows in only the best ideas, and Alts will take any old idea. But sidechains already perform this quality control function. Second, it is attributed to Altcoin greed. Supposedly, Alt-dev exists only to pump its coin. But we Bitcoiners also use our new ideas mostly for hype. The problem is that these (LN, Taproot) are now rare. Third, many Alt ideas --Mimblewimble, zk-snarks, ring signatures, etc-- came first from Bitcoin devs (big Alt-haters, in fact). They simply have no way of moving further through the process, other than as an Alt or as a Sidechain.
