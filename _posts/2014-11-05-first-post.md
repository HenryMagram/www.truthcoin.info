Hi everyone. My name is Paul Sztorc.

I created 'Truthcoin' last December, because I just couldn't live in a world without The Temple of Knowledge, [InTrade.com](https://www.intrade.com/v4/home/).

## Three Goals

However, it turns out that, from a technical perspective, *the idea of "getting reliable data into the blockchain" has other cool uses* (namely, the fabled 'BitUSD', IC Public Goods Provision, and 'Smart Contracts'. That's one of the reasons I'm starting this blog, to **explain** the concept. Only 10 or so people around the net understood InTrade, or why it was important, so I've got my work cut out for me.

A second reason is that: The time for Truthcoin is NOW! Sidechains are [here](http://blockstream.com/)! So time to **promote**.

However, my third reason is to **criticize** other ideas, which I see as "not very good". I hope to take criticism in return, as only through honesty can we speed up evolution.


## (Micro)Econ, Not Tech

I'll be blogging about what I know: "incentives", "mechanisms", "coalitions", "strategic equilibrium", and other **tractable predictions of human behavior**.  I won't be talking about tech/cryptography (I won't be inventing new crypto-tools, just using existing ones), and I probably won't be talking about macro (GDP, Inflation, relationship between Government Spending and x, etc). My favorite micro subject is of course **knowledge:** learning, meta-knowledge, mutual / common, signaling, asymmetric info, induction, etc., so that topic will probably feature heavily.

Of course, I will discuss the design of Truthcoin, my invention, which I consider to be a microeconomic technology and not a cryptographic technology.

Finally, I reserve the right to re-use items I've already written via forum / email / document / email.

Let There Be Blog!
