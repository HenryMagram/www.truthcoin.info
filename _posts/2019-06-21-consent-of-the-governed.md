### Abstract

An anarchist critique of the state, is that public sector transactions are --supposedly-- non-consensual. After all, state operations continue, independently of our protests (or our cheers). In particular, an anarchist might say: "I did not personally sign anything agreeing to pay X in taxes for Y government services -- this is coercion!"

But this line of reasoning doesn't take the idea of "consent" seriously enough. First, consent can be very clearly established, without contracts and signatures -- and, in fact, without any interaction between parties at all. Second, consent can be established in many ways, none of which are perfect nor trump the others -- it is always guesswork. Third, teamwork is valuable and ubiquitous, and so we knkow that people prefer to work/play in teams, at least some of the time. Fourth, it is especially difficult to measure consent among team-members -- team-members have three major incentives to obfuscate the consent-measurement process. In particular we can see how a team would prefer to use inaccurate but cheap consent-measures such as voting, especially when they offer some protection against duress and free-riding.

The quest to improve (or reduce) the public sector, is really a quest for better *technologies* that manage interaction.

## Part 1. Consent is Information

### A. "Giving" Consent

The first idea we must refute is "consent formalism". This is the idea that consent has a "form", for example the form of "a signature, in blue or black ink, on a document prepared by lawyers and then printed out on 8.5 by 11-inch paper".

<!--
Supposedly, once the consent is instantiated in a "form", this form can be traded physically. I can hand over a written debt contract to you, in exchange for a $20 bill. This represents my consenting to borrow twenty dollars US. And supposedly, trading a "consent token" for a "dead president portrait" is no different from trading beads for corn..
-->

But consent cannot be like this. Already, we have run aground at least twice:

1. The written signature could have been forged, in which case it would not represent consent at all.
2. Courts (in the US) treat *verbal* contracts to be legally binding, even though these do not exist in physical "form" anywhere. 

The first inconsistency shows us that *the physical ink* is not necessarily imbued with any consent -- ie: there's nothing special about ink. The second shows us that the same consent *could have* been imbued in many completely different ways.

This is because **consent is information** -- it is the *result* of an information-processing task performed by human brains. And information-giving is quite *unlike* property-giving. I could "give" you my email address, but it would be in an entirely difference sense than if I were to "give" you my sandwich.

One of the important implications of this fact, is that there is not necessarily any connection between *the actions you take* and *your giving of consent*. You can "give" consent, even by doing absolutely nothing, as the following story will show.

### B. The Falling Crane

Consider this scenario: you are walking down a city street; you are violently knocked to the ground; you slowly pick your bruised body up; there is dust in the air; people are shouting -- a few individuals nearby have [apparently] been knocked unconscious; then, you hear a loud creaking sound and observe that a crane nearby is falling towards you (like [this](https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/deadly-crane-collapse-york-city-36750975)). In a few panicked remaining seconds, every able-bodied person, including you, grabs an unconscious person nearby and drags them laterally out of the crane's path.

These were selfless acts of bravery and compassion. But they could technically be construed as "battery" -- the crime of placing your hands on another person *without their permission*. Of course, any judicious observer would *confidently predict* that consent was in fact present. If we could freeze time, and communicate with the unconscious bodies via magical telepathy, we know that they would likely be screaming "Please help!! Yes, please move my body out of the way!! Thank you!".

So we have our desired example: of consent being given, despite no interaction between the two parties. It was simply conjectured into existence.

( This concept may help resolve other supposed consent-puzzles: romance [see [here](http://southpark.cc.com/clips/z61jlw/would-that-be-acceptable) and [here](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/jwmvxd/chappelle-s-show-love-contract)], and parenting [ie, "Am I allowed to 'force' my young/naive child, to attend school / practice the piano / learn manners ?", etc.] )


## Part 2. Consent is Always Known Imperfectly

### A. Proving Guilt

First, let me define three terms: **Truth**, **Knowledge**, and **Proof**.

"Truth" is whether or not something is actually a certain way, "out there" in the external objective reality. "Knowledge", is if your brain [^n] ever creates [a representation](/blog/map-territory) of the "thing" that is accurate (the representation's "way", is the way that the real thing's "way" is). A "Proof" is a new thing (not in your brain) that you can use to *create* knowledge [about the first thing] in others.

[^n]: The representations [don't need to exclusively be inside your mind](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X08712047). They could be in books that you know how to find, in an internet database that you know how to search. But I would not want this section to get too bogged down by epistemology. 

For example: [1] you shoplift on a certain day; [2] someone sees you; and [3] your crime is recorded on surveillance camera. The first is a Truth, the second represents Knowledge (the witness' knowledge of truth [the truth of your guilt]), and the third represents Proof.

Regarding consent, AnCapists often ask critical questions, such as: "Did Alice aggress against Bob, or were their interactions voluntary?". These questions are often philosophical, asked by omniscient narrators for the purpose of examining a specific policy. But when two real people are investigating an actual dispute in the real world, they will not be omniscient. They will not necessarily know anything about what Bob or Alice actually did -- they will only know about *their knowledge of what Bob/Alice did*.

### B. Consent Fallibilism 

Is there a perfect, infallible way to measure consent?

I think the answer must be "no". First, all [knowledge is fallible](www.truthcoin.info/blog/mt-1/), and consent is a form of knowledge. And that ought to be enough.

Imagine you observe an apparent signature on a document. Here are some things that you must understand, in order to determine that the signature represents consent of something:

* forgery
* duress
* intoxication / impairment
* demonstration / thespianism
* literacy / comprehension
* the difficulty of articulating one's mind (in the terms of the contract) in both a compact and unambiguous way.
* all of the rules of English spelling and grammar, including all definitions, connotations, and historical contexts.
* rapidly changing preferences (ie, changing you mind, exactly at the moment a contract is signed) or time inconsistent preferences (ie, hoping to go to the gym tomorrow [but not today] on each individual day of your life).
* human psychology, specifically: theory-of-mind, agency, attention, etc.
* the relationship between "signatures" and "consent" in Western culture.
* the relationship between specific names and specific people.
* the identifying characteristics of "a signature" (eg, "What is a signature anyway?").
* the laws of physics that govern the behavior of ink, paper, light, safety deposit boxes, etc.
* the existence of "deceptive" products, such as 'invisible ink' or Photoshop; and of how these work, and the contexts in which they would be too difficult to use.

When we observe signatures on documents (or handshakes after lengthy verbal negotiations), we may conclude that consent has been given. But only because we pair that observation with innumerable pre-existing assumptions, each of which is potentially mistaken.

* [Consent: yes or no? Whale vs Human misunderstanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTw8MR67xv8)


### C. Cost of Consent-Proving

Knowledge-creation is expensive. It costs effort to make, just as it costs effort to make a chair or an ice cream sandwich. Even if every citizen wanted to spend their scarce free time, to investigate every transaction in the economy for fraud (itself a dubious prospect), the simple fact is that they just do not have enough time to do so. (More in Part 4).

Courts are society's specialists in this area. They are fallible, but a reliable "proof" exists at least of the outcome of their decision. While people can disagree over the facts of each case, they can't really disagree about "what the court ultimately decided to do"[^n]. Thus the dispute ends.

[^n]: Fans of Bitcoin may appreciate [this correct usage of the term "proof"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=721.msg8114#msg8114): "Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen."

### D. Rejecting CM Nihilism

In saying these things, I am not endorsing defeatism or pessimism; nor I am trying to give cover to tyrants. In fact, as we will see, my rejection of "naive consent-measurement" is an essential step toward defeating tyranny.

It *is* possible to measure consent; and it is possible to do so efficiently. Those who shirk their consent-measuring duties are committing an injustice.


## Part 3. Building Teamwork

I will define a **group** as: "more than one individual". And I will define a **team** as: a group which cooperates (engages in [purposeful coordinated activity](https://meltingasphalt.com/minimum-viable-superorganism/)).

### A. Teamwork

Teamwork is valuable.

For example:

* Bands that rehearse, perform better than bands that don't. A coordinated army will defeat an undisciplined militia. Wall-building has O(n) costs but covers O(n^2) surface area. Roads cost O(n) to build but provide O(n^2) routes (an example of Metcalfe's Law).
* Some things cost O(1) to make, but provide benefit to n people. Knowledge, for example, spreads freely and immediately to everyone (as well as art, literature, etc). Public roads -- until very recently, road-privatization required innumerable tolls and barriers (and stopping at these would tend to contradict the purpose of building the roads in the first place).
* Conversely, certain *bad things* spread at O(n^2), but can be halted at cost O(n). Such as: fire, infectious disease, lawlessness/rioting, poor mental health [leading to melancholy, depression], poor social health \[leading to formation of gangs, cults\] (and probably also: mass shootings, hysteria, etc).
* Sometimes, one person can ruin something for everyone. For example: suppressing unwanted noise (at a library, orchestra concert, or during 'quiet hours'), electromagnetic inference (as in radio/tv/cellular broadcasting), spread of secrets (covert military operations, spies). Medical surgery; serene experiences (a nice dinner party, geopolitical negotiations); existential maintenance of the planet (Global Warming, [Grey Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo)), etc.

### B. Teamwork-Constructors

Anarcho-Capitalists do not dispute the effectiveness of teamwork. Instead, they object to certain processes by which teamwork comes about.

So, how does teamwork 'come about', anyway? And which 'how-it-come-abouts' do the anarchists object to?

#### i. Information Diffusion

Well, when many different people comply with a defined plan, it must be because two conditions were met: [1] they all knew what to do, and [2] each person felt motivated to do their part. In other words, a specific type of knowledge diffused through the group -- a "group computation". Everyone obtained enough of the plan to understand both [1] their role in it and [2] that it was in their best interest to follow the plan[^n].

[^n]: Obviously, the plan is often rejected -- even under [extreme conditions of duress](https://www.amazon.com/Runaway-Slaves-John-Hope-Franklin/dp/0195084519).

There are many ways of accomplishing this knowledge-diffusion task, just as there are many ways of constructing a bridge between two points of land. For example: one way is "deliberation-and-consent" -- for everyone to share all of the information they have, and discuss until everyone agrees. A second way is "threaten-and-submission"; a third is "majority-vote-and-resignation".

The constructors can operate on different levels -- for example, people can agree to participate in a democracy, but if they feel the democratic process is not respected they may decide to support a military coup. People may sign written contracts, and then later make ad hoc verbal clarifications without ever bothering to write these down.

The foundation of social compliance is, of course, psychological / biological. Let us break this down even further.

#### ii. Norms and Meta-Norms

"Behavioral **norms**" are "ideas about how to behave, when interacting with other people". Such as:

* "when you meet someone new, shake their hand"
* "do not use vulgar words if young children are nearby"
* "do not use the n-word ever, unless you have dark skin"
* "respect 'personal space' -- move nearest the people you know well"
* "over-fortunate people should share generously"

Most of our informal social norms *evolved*, via natural selection. They're memes in [the true, Dawkins sense of the word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme). They are contagious behaviors that survive by copying themselves into host brains as quickly and reliably as possible. They are enforced via shame, pride, by altering social rank and who is allowed to reproduce or obtain property, etc.[^n]

[^n]: Biologically, when we are out of sync with the local *genes*, we experience illness -- indigestion or infection. Similarly, when we are out of sync with the local *memes*, we experience mental illness -- awkwardness, anxiety, and depression.

Resources: 

* Basic -- [Recent Post Classifying Some Modern Norms](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/12/11/norms-of-membership-for-voluntary-groups/)
* Advanced -- [Robin Hanson on Norms](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/12/10-implications-of-automatic-norms.html) (and [again](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/03/egalitarian-complaints.html))
* Experiments -- [Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEhSk71gUCQ) and [Monkeys (?)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/games-primates-play/201203/what-monkeys-can-teach-us-about-human-behavior-facts-fiction); [Memes](http://curi.us/1824-static-memes-and-irrationality)

These rules quite literally create and enforce themselves -- via "meta-norms" (norms about norms) that encourage people to gossip about norm-violators (and their associates and parents), and to punish violators by withholding cooperation and/or friendship. These meta-norms are norms which specialize in removing unwanted people from the team (thus protecting the team's cooperative integrity).

Taken together, the ensemble of norms (especially including the meta-norms) are **"teamwork constructors"** -- metaphorical machines that "take in" multiple independent individuals and "spit out" [provisionally] some teamwork.

### C. Teamwork-Specialists

#### i. Laws

A **law** is a formally engineered rule. Unlike norms, laws are written with intent -- they are consciously desired modifications to society's culture.

Without psychological force backing them up, laws would merely be imperceptible shapes on invisible paper. Laws *do* have psychological force behind them, however. Laws receive their power from special norms, such as: "we should have respect for the law" and "you should avoid associating with criminals" and even "it is better to talk things out, rather than use violence".

In everyday life, [norms often trump laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unenforced_law), as when the law against speeding is trumped by a cultural norm allowing drivers to go 5-10 mph over the limit. The converse is also true -- laws can eventually trump norms. Especially: [a] after the law is enforced for a while and becomes the status quo (after which most people won't know how to get rid of it), or [b] if the law accomplishes some noble purpose in a way that is easy to understand.

See also:

* [Family vs Law](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/05/beware-extended-family.html#more-30410)
* ["None of your Business"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/06/road-rage-is-morality.html)

Exactly as with norms, those who violate laws (and who refuse to bring themselves back into compliance) are eventually "removed from the team" (ie, removed from citizenship). This means incarceration, or execution.

#### ii. Contracts

Western law will (usually) enforce **contracts**. Contracts are situations where people are allowed to simultaneously: [1] agree to a very specific plan, and [2] agree to be punished by the law if they do not accomplish their part. They're pure teamwork!

Contract-enforcement is a great feature of a legal system, as it allows for exquisite customization of teamwork-agreements. And these agreements affect only those who "opt in" to the agreement.

However, why should contracts accomplish anything at all? The answer: because our legal system has [1] defined what a valid contract is and when one has been created, and [2] will itself enforce contracts. So, there is a 'meta-contract' (saying "the court system will enforce valid contracts"); just as there were 'meta-norms' (gossip that punished norm-evaders).

If there were no 'meta-contract', (or if "opting out" of it were too easy), then anyone could retroactively escape *all previously signed contracts*, de facto making them all unenforceable (and therefore pointless). So, if contracting is to have any meaning at all, the meta-contract must be firmly in place. And it must change very slowly, so as to minimally disturb all of the consensual arrangements that rest on top of it.

#### iii. Government

The "meta contract" is better known as **The Law** -- "the set of currently applicable laws in a country". The Law is changed by **Governments** -- people who specialize in lawmaking, and law-enforcing. For example, the US Supreme Court [changed gay marriage laws in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States), and Congress changed [credit-default-swap laws in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000).

The government itself can be changed (ie **"Revolutions"**) according to a deeper, even more "meta" ruleset - a "meta-meta-contract" that describes exactly how much governing-error a critical mass of the citizenry will tolerate. If you succeed at a deeper layer, it trumps any of the "rules" of the upper layers[^n]. (The deepest ruleset of all, would simply be the laws of physics.)

### D. Definition Review

* Group -- More than one individual.
* Team -- A group that coordinates, to achieve its member's goals.
* Norms -- Ideas about how to behave, when interacting with other people. Informal.
* Laws -- Formal norms.
* Government -- The teammates who specialize in [creating, enforcing, and interpreting] laws, and in [enforcing and defining] contracts.
* Rights -- Motivations of the landlord (see appendix).

I have now given my definition of "government". And, in the previous section, I have given my definition of "consent". We can now discuss what it would mean for a government to operate "with the consent of the governed".

## Part 4. The Hard Problems of Consent-Measurement ### {#part4}

Anarchists feel that each individual should have to "give" consent, to all of the laws that they are later expected to obey. In other words, if Jeff-the-Anarchist hasn't signed off on a law personally, then he should not be bound by it.

This is 100% exactly correct.

The problem is: how do we know *which laws* Jeff-the-Anarchist has signed off on (and which he hasn't)?

Unfortunately, it is much harder than it first seems. It is certainly not as simple as printing out each law, and passing them around for each citizen to sign. Consent-Measurement is different from the measurement of temperature, or length, because Consent-Measurement is disrupted, at a fundamental level, by (at least) three "Obfuscators":

1. **Free-Riding** -- The incentive to misrepresent consent as non-consent, out of greed for free stuff.
2. **Duress** -- The incentive to misrepresent non-consent as consent, for social reasons (real or imagined).
3. **Cost-of-Measurement** -- Consent-measurement is not free -- it consumes resources. If consent is under-measured, coercion thrives; but if it is over-measured, then the measuring process itself has become coercive.

The first two are context-specific incentive problems. The third is a fundamental paradox.

Below I discuss each in detail.


### A. Free-Riding ### {#free-riding}

    Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
    By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe!
    -Boromir at the Council of Elrond, The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)

Imagine two hills, each with fourteen ~equal-sized plots of land:

![images](/images/two-hills.png)

The townsfolk are being harassed by wolves and are in dire need of protection. Walls are the proposed solution.

It is noticed that the most efficient wall-construction is to build two long ovals, one per hill, each around all fourteen lots simultaneously. (Walls have the "more efficient with teamwork" property, as we discussed.)

LeftBerg, the left hill, endorses voluntarism -- they enforce commercial contracts by refusing to trade with any oathbreakers.

In contrast, RightBerg declares for monarchy -- they grants their King sole authority, over the building of walls and the defense of the hill. When the WallBuilding Corporation approaches the King, the King taxes the citizens equally -- each landowner[^n] pays (1/14) the cost of the wall, plus some extra for the King's salary.

[^n]: Things would probably be worse if the tax were collected on some other basis. According to [a well-known theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George_theorem), when land-utilization is static(*), the total value of all "public goods" (of all kinds) is captured by nearby landlords. Walls, public partsk, welfare payments, UBI, etc -- all of this value-add, translates to higher rents. 100% of these proceeds ultimately go to landlords. Thus, the most efficient way to collect taxes is via land-value tax. --- --- (*) A plot of land is a kind of "natural factory" that produces goods over time -- it may produce housing, or crops, fish, lumber, etc. A high-rise will produce more housing per month than a single family home; and an irrigated farm will produce more food per month than fallow wilderness. H. George chooses to examine the case where land-use is static and cannot improve (for whatever reason -- zoning, negotiation costs, insufficient technology, etc). The best improvements (from the public point of view) are transportation improvements that bring improved [high-rent] land within travel distance of unimproved [cheap-rent] land.

But what happens when the WallBuilding Corporation approaches LeftBerg?

The inner landowners (C1-C4) may be thinking strategically. They may guess that the outer owners (L1-L5 and R1-R5) greatly desire the wall, and can afford it. If this is indeed the case, then there is no longer any relationship between their "buy" decision and their receipt of the product. -- If they consent to buy the wall, they will each pay (1/14) and receive a wall. But if they do *not* consent to buy the wall, they will pay nothing and get the wall anyway.

So, *it is exactly as if* WallBuilding Corp approached the C1-C4 landowners and asked them if they would like to freely donate an amount of money (one-fourteenth the wall's cost) for absolutely no reason.

Perhaps guilt, or a sense of honor, will motivate the charitable donations of C1-C4. But this unreliable strategy is spoiled by numerous perverse incentives: it rewards the most shameless, or silver-tongued landowners; or the most illiquid or truly impoverished landowners (who are therefore truly unable to pay -- shielding their honor from measurement).

So ultimately we can expect rational landowners to decline to pay for the wall, regardless of how much they truly desire it. Normally in economics, a decline-to-pay means that the good is unwanted. But here that is not so -- C1-C4 might very clearly want to pay for something, but **lie about this** in the hopes of getting an even better deal. They are fishing for unearned sympathy, with **fake complaints**.

In RightBerg, the King could weigh C1-C4's protests (about being "forced" to pay for the wall), against their suspiciously coincidental interest in free-riding. But in LeftBerg, nothing is working to improve the biased measurement.

#### Aside

Nothing I write, above or below, is an endorsement of Monarchy per se. Dictatorship is simply an effective contrast to anarchy.

The critical issue is *the extent to which the process is accurately measuring consent*. A monarchy will have its own consent-measuring issues: egomania, slick advisors, suppression of dissent, etc. If the King has any superstitious beliefs --about "the Jews", for example, ...or women-- these might go uncorrected for generations, disenfranchising the unlucky subset of the population.

<!--
-- Fake Complaining -- 
Often, friends of yours will complain about their job or their relationship. But, they won't do anything about it. Possibly they are *unable* to do anything about it. But, more likely, their situation is more-or-less acceptable to them.

But, suspiciously, they don't do anything about it. Are they truly dissatisfied? Or are they instead just fishing for unearned sympathy?
-->


Now, on to the second fundamental problem.

### B. Duress ### {#duress}

    The beatings will continue until morale improves.
    -(Unknown Origin)

#### i. Apparatchiks

Consider this famous passage from Solzhenitsyn's ['The Gulag Archipelago'](https://books.google.com/books?id=7Q7-CDK0G24C&pg=PA70&dq=%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t+ever+be+the+first+to+stop+applauding.%E2%80%9D+gulag&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDlLet_YvXAhWMNiYKHenwC4wQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t%20ever%20be%20the%20first%20to%20stop%20applauding.%E2%80%9D%20gulag&f=false):

    At the conclusion of the conference, a tribute to Comrade Stalin was called
    for. Of course, everyone stood up...the small hall echoed with stormy
    applause... For three minutes, four minutes, five minutes, the [applause]
    continued. ...the older people were panting from exhaustion. It was becoming
    insufferably silly even to those who really adored Stalin. However, who would
    dare be the /first/ to stop? ... NKVD men [secret police] were standing in
    the hall applauding and watching to see /who/ quit first! And in that
    obscure, small hall, unknown to the Leader [Stalin was not in the room!], the
    applause went on--six, seven, eight minutes! ... Then, after eleven minutes,
    the director of the paper factory assumed a businesslike expression and sat
    down in his seat. And, oh, a miracle took place! ... To a man, everyone else
    stopped dead and sat down. They had been saved!
        That, however, was how they [NKVD secret police] discovered who the
    independent people were. And that was how they went about eliminating them.
    That same night the factory director was arrested. They easily pasted ten
    years [in a labor camp] on him ...

From this, one might conclude that the Soviet people were thrilled with their government! But we know that the opposite was true.

#### ii. Consent-Measurement Technology

Soviet *elections* had features that we in the West would consider to be grotesque, or even humorous.

First, all blank ballots --and, in practice, all *uncast* ballots-- were automatically treated as votes for the Communist Party. As you might expect, this policy led to [comically high voter turnout levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_legislative_election,_1950), literally of 100%. (USA turnout is usually 50%-60%.)

So, off the bat, one party has a near-unassailable advantage. But *fairness* is not the issue here; instead, it's *suppression* of some voices --the dissenting voices-- that is problematic. If your goal is to measure consent --to understand which opinions the citizen's *truly* hold-- it is (obviously) counterproductive to a priori suppress *any* opinions.

Observe [this account of Soviet election logistics](https://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/communistelectionsslovakia.html) for more insights:

    The ballot box was placed at the center of the room 
    in front of the 4-5 member committee who checked off
    people's names and gave each a ballot with preprinted
    names ... To adjust the ballots in private, the voter
    would have to remember to bring a pen or pencil and
    walk, observed by the committee, to the far corner of
    the room where the Communists placed a small screen
    with a table and a pen or pencil, sometimes broken
    according to informal internal instructions so that
    the voter would need to go back to the committee and
    ask for a new one. Before the election day, people
    were enjoined to "vote manifestly," that is to pick
    up the ballot from the committee, turn around, and
    drop it off in the ballot box right away.

Obviously, these policies make the election a foregone conclusion. But in doing so, they contradict the purpose of the election in the first place.

#### iii. People vs Processes -- Ingratiation

While monarchy/dictatorship/oligarchy is a **rule-by-person(s)**, a democracy [with free elections] is a **rule-by-process**. The distinction, [captured here by Popper](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited), is crucial.

With rule-by-person you know exactly who to start fawning over / sucking up to[^n]. The measuring-process is NOT 'prior to' the government itself, and so the existing government will have some kind of "say in the matter", as we saw in the USSR example above.

Since everyone is blind to their own mistakes, the existing government will have a bias that they are literally unable to detect. As a result, rule-by-persons will be difficult to improve.

[^n]: In fact, the mere *suggestion* that the government might soon transition into a rule-by-person, might be enough to coerce many people into immediately submitting to that person. Such suggestions are themselves tyrannical. See [Roko's Basilisk argument](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk); and see also the behavior and rhetorical style of [cult leaders throughout history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult#Destructive_cults). It is also not necessarily for anyone to act maliciously or even willfully -- consider that Christians and Muslims live in total obedience to a tyrant that, as far as anyone can tell, doesn't exist at all.

In contrast, if *a process* rules, then there is no one to ingratiate. When citizens vote, they have no reason to yield to intimidation or coercion. As Schelling described the secret ballot: "any punishment or reward they receive will be unrelated to the way that they actually voted".

#### iv. Why should each vote count equally?

The most popular answer is *egalitarianism* -- the doctrine that each human life has equal value. Equal value; equal votes.

But notice that 'counting the votes equally' also makes them maximally indistinguishable from each other. After all, **voter privacy** is the highest when [1] the person-ballot assignments are as *interchangeable* as possible, and [2] the total quantity of ballots cast is high. So the loud quest for "equality", universal suffrage, "one [wo]man one vote", etc may have been, all along, a hidden quest for privacy. See also [compulsory voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting).

Privacy is quite essential, if your goal is accurate consent measurement (and therefore, minimizing coercion).

But it gets better. Privacy (specifically, in this example: "free elections") encourages discussion, debate, and truth. In contrast, dictatorship suppresses discussion, harbors confusion, and enshrines errors.

How is this so? Well, when *what voters say in public* is not necessarily related to *the actual election outcome*, then politicians know to ignore what people say. Instead, politicians ignore vapid applause (which might be Stalin-esque "forced applause") and try to make sure they know what citizens *really* want. They will be skeptical of fawning advisors, and apparatchik supporters. Even better: since citizens are free to air their grievances in public, they probably *will* air their grievances in public.

    The essence of democratic decision-making is not the choice made by the
    system at elections, but the ideas created between elections.
    -David Deutsch, Beginning of Infinity p 345

    "Communication occurs only between equals."
    -Celiene's Second Law, phrased by Wilson

Democracy ("free elections") can accommodate *unpopular "silent truths"*. In fact, the 2016 Election of Trump is one salient example -- apparently, many people supported Trump, but weren't comfortable showing this support openly.

![image](/images/kasparov-unpredictable-election.png)

Above: A [tweet](https://twitter.com/kasparov63/status/940797116095528960) on the 2016 Trump election, from Garry Kasparov (chairman HRF, founder UCF), advocate of liberty, resident of USSR 1963-1992.

"Surprising" candidates should win occasionally -- they are why we use secret ballots.

<!--
#### v. Icky Policies

Democracy (ie "the secret ballot") addresses this problem only imperfectly. 

criminalization of drug use and lgbt rights took place -- felt uncomfortable supporting them in public.

#### v. "Selected By Consumers"

Finally, we can apply this lesson to Anarcho-Capitalism.

From wikipedia (emphasis added): "In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors **selected by consumers** rather than centrally through confiscatory taxation."

But *how do we know* what it is that the consumers have selected? If consumers must "sign" legal documents stating their preference for Court X over Court Y, then what prevents neo-Stalin from just forging a bunch of legal documents saying that the citizens have agreed to prefer Court Stalin (and that they also prefer agricultural collectivism, a one-party state, etc)? Without a strong consent-measuring process, nothing guarantees that citizens will actually get the services that they select.

    For the Constitution, rather than suggesting that
    all behave in a godlike manner, recognizes that,
    to the contrary, people are swine
    and will take any opportunity to subvert
    any agreement in order to pursue
    what they consider to be their proper interests.

Above: quote [from Mamet](https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/03/11/david-mamet-why-i-am-no-longer-a-brain-dead-liberal/).

Now the third and final problem of consent-measurement.

### C. Cost-of-Measurement


    Stossel: Why does it take you three years to build a bathroom?
    ...
    NYC Parks Commissioner: Ours, because it's a public project, we believe very strongly in engaging the public.
    ...
    Stossel: And this is a good thing...all these meetings?
    NYC PC: Oh yes it's a good thing.
    ...
    Random Citizen: It's a ridiculous amount of money.

Above: ["Stossel: $2 Million Bathroom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfAE5emMCs8), (3:50-4:22).

Deliberation isn't free. Every resource spent checking someone's consent, is one that is consumed (and cannot be used to achieve other useful purposes).

#### i. The Laffer Curve

There is a famous idea in economics called the Laffer Curve. It attempts to quickly show a non-linear relationship between tax rates charged, and ultimate tax revenues collected.

It runs as follows: First, Laffer points out that, obviously, if income tax rates were 0%, then no income taxes would ever be collected. Second, he points out that if income tax rates were 100%, then citizens would uniformly turn away from work (ie, toward leisure), because all of their work-earnings would be confiscated. Yet -- when tax rates are *between* 0% and 100%, some taxes are indeed collected. Therefore, it must theoretically be possible, sometimes, for the government to collect *more* total money by charging a *lower* tax-rate.

![laffer-optimum](/images/laffer.png)

Above: Laffer Curve, taken from [this page](https://www.quora.com/The-Laffer-Curve-completely-ignores-the-realities-of-our-progressive-tax-system-in-which-income-is-taxed-at-different-rates-We-could-have-a-top-tax-bracket-of-100-as-FDR-proposed-and-still-collect-tax-revenue-Why-is-it-taken-seriously).

#### ii. Over-Measuring Consent

If a taxing authority is ultimately responsible for consent-measurement, a parallel argument is immediately available. We make one substitution: replace "tax rates", with "(%) of resources devoted to consent-measurement (CM)". Then, it is the same: the redirection of resources will discourage production, and, at a 100% rate, there will be no production at all. And so there will be no resources available *to be* used for consent-measurement. So it will be self-defeating -- by pursuing CM aggressively, we will have failed to achieve any CM.

That's already quite bad. But the above paragraph is not the sense in which I want to replicate Laffer's argument. So let us first cancel that first effect out completely, so we can examine a new one that is even worse.

We will imagine that production is not discouraged at all[^n], when we direct resources to CM.

[^n]: It is not necessary to justify this assumption, since I do not believe it and my argument actually does better if it is false. But one justification could be that all people suddenly decide that they enjoy the activity of consent-measurement, as much (or more) than they enjoy any other activity (including eating and drinking). So they are always willing to buy more CM, at any price. Perhaps this could be due to a kind of ethical awakening -- an absolute commitment to the doctrine of voluntaryism.

![laffer2](/images/laffer-consent.png)

As promised, we have a second Laffer paradox. As always, it manifests along the extremes:

First, the left-extreme: If a culture dedicates 0% of its resources to CM, then no one will know if any interactions are consensual. So coercion can never be proven, demonstrated, or even noticed. And so property-right-violations can never be detected, let alone punished. And so property rights cannot be enforced -- thieves will have free reign, and as a result society will avoid producing anything valuable enough to be worth stealing. Those skilled in violence, theft, and coercion will thrive the most, under such a society.

Second, the right-extreme: Imagine that a culture dedicates 100% of its resources to CM. Citizens will now know --par excellence-- the extent to which their interactions are consensual. Any coercion will be detected and known, to the greatest possible extent. The problem, of course, is that there will be no resources available to enjoy life! No agriculture, transportation, etc. The *measuring process* would itself be a tyrant, turning all citizen's labor towards CM.

In other words, if we were perfectionists about CM, we would spend our lives measuring the interactions around us with greater and greater precision...*whether we wanted to do this or not*. We would all be slaves, to the question "is everyone ok with this?".

![teamwork](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dtd1eSTU8AEytOm.jpg:large)

Above: "Arguing forever" about roads, (from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeyRhett/status/1069452700159488000)).

Thus, we have our second Laffer paradox: sometimes, society becomes *more consensual overall*, by using a less-accurate (but cheaper) consent-measurement process.

It follows that *over-measuring* consent is actually a form of coercion. We can deduce by argument, therefore, that all people everywhere do consent to the use of "short cuts" in CM.

So, CM is not just inherently imperfect. CM **must be** imperfect. It must be undertaken **lazily** -- ie, with deference to the citizen's limited resources. Else it will itself become coercive.

How lazy should we be? Well, I do not think the question has a clear answer. And certainly not a permanent one. Proper CM probably requires ongoing refinement, the same way we improve any business process or chemical process or customer service process over time.

    He [the US President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice
    and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties...
    --Article II, section 2, of the US Constitution

-->

#### iii. Informed Consent vs. Specialization

There is wide agreement among ethicists that consent must be *informed* -- people must *know* the options before they choose among them. If they didn't, their choice to "consent" to something, would not have any connection to that thing (or to how they felt about it). So they'd be consenting to a blank slate.

To avoid that meaningless outcome, consent must be "informed consent".

Now, if we say that "a group has consented", do we mean that each and every individual in the group has given their informed consent? If so, we immediately reach a problem: a team's decision-making abilities are limited to the brainpower of the team's single dumbest member. Instead, if the team had specialist leaders (to whom loyalists deferred), it could make decisions that are *even smarter* than the guesses of its single brightest generalist.

So we immediately reach a *third* Laffer paradox! First, people prefer that "their group" *be better*, and make *smarter* decisions, of course. So they prefer to defer to experts. But, on the other hand, people prefer "their group" to serve *their own* interests (and not the tyranny of the self-proclaimed "experts").

But they cannot have it both ways: either they defer to experts, or they do not. This is a timeless problem that is inherent to the nature of specialization itself: [The Principal-Agent Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem).

They cannot escape the trade-off by *learning*. Because any effort spent *teaching* citizens about decisions, would be effort that could not be deployed toward *actually doing* the best plans.

Without specialized knowledge of the local area / local phenomena, residents will have no way of knowing that they are doing anything wrong. And it will not always be efficient to explain all of this to them.

Or does it?


#### iv. Implications of Obfuscator 3

From these examples, we know that people do not value "non-aggression" (consensual action) above all other things. People decline to even *investigate* the extent to which their society contains aggression. And good for them -- if they cared about that too much, they would die.

### D. Conclusion of Part 4 

Measuring "the consent of the governed" is very hard.

1. Free-Riding -- Citizens have incentives to misrepresent their consent.
2. Duress -- Power-hungry tyrants have incentives to intercept citizen's opinions.
3. Cost of CM -- The measuring process is itself expensive and inconvenient.

The Consent Measurement (CM) technology currently in use in most [UK-sourced nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Former_British_colonies) is **the [FPTP Secret Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)**.

An [inferior](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited) technology in use in other Western nations is **the [PR Secret Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation)**.

The two are often [combined, in numerous variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electoral_systems_by_country).

In a monarchy, the CM technology in use is **"the royal opinion"**. (This is the worst CM-tech yet. Pro-Monarchy revolutionaries [and [subjects](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/a-king-is-fine-so-long-as-hes-one-of-us.html)] often assume that the King will generally agree with *them* (over other people). This is quite naive...and all-the-more-so when it is believed by many heterogeneous monarchists simultaneously!)

Finally, anarchism and voluntarism are worth mentioning.

These traditionally interchangeable ideas, I believe should be separated into opposites, based on how one is supposed to react to apparent coercion.

I define anarchism as the complete lack of any culturally-enforced CM. If you observe apparent coercion, while walking down the street, then you look the other way and mind your own business.

I define voluntarism as a culture where anyone who tolerates coercion is shunned. If you observe apparent coercion, or hear any gossip about possible coercion, then you investigate it immediately. If there is coercion, you gossip about it and cancel all of your deals with the coercer.

Thus, the CM-technology in anarchism is **nothing** and the CM-tech in voluntarism is  **[complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph) gossip**. Both are impractical -- the first is an invitation to tyranny[^n], and the second cannot scale past a group of 12-15 people (see Obfuscator 3).

[^n]: In particular, the first is a clue as to why ["voluntary slavery"](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/01/walter-e-block/scurrilous-libelous-venomous/) would need to be banned from any free society, or at the least be highly regulated. The transactional nature of the interaction is not the issue here, instead it is the measurement of consent -- if you see an enslaved person, how are you to know that they volunteered for slavery (or were ever compensated)? You cannot just walk up and ask them (see [GoT s04e08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQlgIjf2jdg)). And, this epistemic shield gives cover to actual slavers and kidnappers, and would tend to increase the overall level of coercion in a society.


There is no limit to how much we can improve our CM technology.


## Part 5. Interactivity Filters

### A. Perfecting the Art

Certainly no modern government is perfect.

But as bad as things are today, they were worse in the recent past. Remember the fugitive slave act? Civil war [slavery-and-torture-based](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a25915/punishment-and-torture-in-the-civil-war-111413/) obedience training? That time that NYPD misconduct led to a guy being [impaled alive on an iron fence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/scotts/ftp/bulgarians/stonewall.txt)? Talk about awkward.

People back then just didn't know any better. Specifically, they didn't know *how to construct* a better society. They didn't know which ingredients were needed, or how to furnish them or combine them the right way. We can't be too judgmental -- our society is far from perfect, and not enough people know the best way of improving it.

Over time, we will get better at determining which activities should be collectively, and how. As with everything else, progress is a function of our knowledge and technology.

### B. Interactivity-Filtration Tech

When people congregate, the potential for interaction increases.

This includes *desirable* interactions -- such as trade and knowledge-sharing; but it also includes *undesirable* interactions -- such as violence and fraud.

* [Negative Interactions on the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPOZl5FzxbU)

Inevitably, people search for ways (ie *technologies*) to maximize the former and minimize the latter.

These "interactivity filters" seem to operate in two ways:

1. **Shamers** -- Technologies that detect, measure, and prove rule-violations. Examples of Shamers are: gossip; revenge; law-enforcement; police body cameras. 
2. **Dampers** -- Technologies that lessen the impact of other people's harassment. Examples of Dampers are: airplane sleeping masks; walls (especially soundproof ones); social media "block" buttons.

At the orchestra, the audience is expected to sit silently (Shamer-tech); at a rock concert, the music is so loud, that it remains audible in spite of noise made by the audience (Damper-tech).

Shamers allow teams to achieve their most fundamental and existential goal: the ejection of saboteurs (ie, of *anti-members* of the team). Dampers allow individuals to safely congregate within team-building range of others, without needing to worry about their behavior or that of others.

As technology improves, society will change unpredictably. And so we can also see the unwanted appearance of:

* **Entanglers** -- Phenomena of significantly increased interactivity (especially unexpectedly). For example: population density --> epidemic; 1666-era London building codes / lifestyles --> spread of fire; physics breakthroughs --> the atomic bomb; banking/telecom advancements --> central banking; transit/logistics improvements --> globalization; fintech/mis-regulation --> 1996-2008 era ["securitization food chain"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GFoJeZbuWw&list=PL233326A66319E9E1&index=2&t=42).

Adding Dampers is called **"Privatization"**. Adding/editing Shamers is called **"Regulation"**. Taken together, the overall management of interaction within a group is called the **"Governance"** of that group.

One of my favorite stories, Animal Farm, is (as I see it) about a situation where a political revolution is accompanied by *zero* changes in Shamers, Dampers, or Entanglers. So society never actually changes. True revolutions always involve Better Ideas.

One better idea is the blockchain. Your Bitcoin full node allows you to ignore other people's payment fraud / counterfeiting (it is a Damper)[^n].

[^n]: Bitcoin full nodes do Shaming, as well (in the same way that BitTorrent does). When trying to download new blocks, Full Nodes need to know who is sending them valid-needed-data, and who is spamming them with junk. When spam is detected, the offending node is banned from the P2P network -- they are kicked off the team (Shaming).

I believe a greatly under-appreciated governance idea is the [Hans](http://blog.oddhead.com/2008/12/22/what-is-and-what-good-is-a-combinatorial-prediction-market/)[onian](http://blog.oddhead.com/2006/10/30/implementing-hansons-market-maker/) ["prediction market"](www.BitcoinHivemind.com). It *very efficiently* shames suboptimal politicians, making it easy for us to only elect optimal politicians.


### C. Is Liberty Fundamental?

Although this essay critiques Anarchism, I think it also endorses Libertarianism.

As I have explained, a public sector transaction is one where the buyer and seller have great difficulty communicating with each other. It's like bartering in a foreign language.

Because of this, we can reliably expect the public sector to *make mistakes*. The construction, enforcement, and administration of laws is fundamentally prone to error. This error opens up special "careers", geared towards people who specialize in exploiting the error: economic parasites, propagandists, corruption, and further wrongdoing.

Civic mistakes in popular culture:

* [Best of Mayor Quimby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-zzbkT712k)
* [Best of Chief Wiggum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQuvnp9Gso)

So we should treat every public sector transaction with suspicion. In particular, we should assume that our laws are defective, and we should always be looking for ways to replace them. And for better ways of [noticing when they need replacing](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4334356/larry-page-wants-to-set-aside-a-part-of-the-world-for-experimentation).

## Conclusion

1. Consent is *informational* (guessed into existence by the audience) -- "giving" consent is different than "giving" a sandwich.
2. There is *no infallible way* to measure consent. We can only do the best we can, being mindful that we will necessarily make mistakes. In contrast, it is easy to check and see what a given specialist decided (about a given consent-dispute).
3. *Teamwork is valuable.* Team members must abide by the team's norms, including the meta-norms. Laws are formal, intentional norms created by specialists.
4. When a group updates its norms and laws, three phenomena *"obfuscate"* the process of consent-measurement: free riding (in which consenters have an incentive to claim non-consent), duress (in which non-consenters have an incentive to claim consent), and cost-of-consent-measurement (in which citizens have an incentive to spend as few resources on consent-measurement as possible). 
5. The quest for better government, is really a quest for better *interactivity-management technologies*


### Appendix: Rights

This was originally Part 3, Section D. But it isn't relevant to the conclusion, so I moved it here.

#### i. Laws vs Rights

Just as laws "advise" people on how to behave, Rights "advise" laws on what they should say.

<!-- somewhat like the difference between Ethics and Morals -->

Whereas Laws are specific, concrete, numerous, contain exceptions, and are occasionally revised or removed, Rights are general, abstract, few in number, contain very few exceptions, and are almost never revised or removed.

In this sense, Rights are a kind of Platonic Ideal toward which the individual imperfect Laws strive. We can evaluate a portfolio of laws, based on how well they serve a set of Rights.

#### ii. From where do we get our rights?

The opening quotation of this essay claimed that it was "self-evident" that men were endowed with "unalienable Rights" to Life and Liberty. But this cannot be literally true. Since the document's publication in 1776, nearly all the Americans living under its protection have died (against their will), at some point or another. So the Right to Life was de facto alienable. Worse, the quotation says that rights came from "[our] Creator" -- first introducing theology into the equation, but second implying that if Creator changed His mind, we would then lose all of our rights. And that doesn't seem to make any sense either. So we cannot take the Declaration's advice in this case.

Some people feel that Rights need to be "derived from" something. But this also doesn't seem to be true. The things we *build*, are constructed using tools and ingredients that almost never resemble the final product. And the things we *want* certainly don't seem to be "derived from" anything nearby (people just 'get hungry', whether they think about it or not) -- and if someone *wanted* to want something new (ie, a want not derived from a previous want), it isn't clear why this should be 'prohibited' (or whatever).

#### iii. Rights are Objective Norms

In my view, Rights (the real ones that we actually get in reality) are just *objective norms*. They are behavioral guidelines that are near-universally endorsed. When a group of people is pretty sure that they *all* want the group to behave a certain way, then you have a Right. This is why Rights need to be simple, uncontroversial, few in number, containing few exceptions, etc.

It is also why it is strategically advantageous to *say* that a hypothetical new Right has been "derived from" something that's already popular and well-known (such as God), even if in fact it wasn't -- the supporters of the new Right won't care enough to even look into it in the first place, and the detractors will be hung up on trying to refute the derivation (and since all refutations are arguments, the supporters can just pretend that they weren't convinced -- so it costs them nothing).

Since Rights should apply universally ([independently of a person's individual situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position)), we should be able to discover them over time, the same way we discover the laws of physics. We should also be able to discover *faster ways of discovering the best Rights*. 

<!-- what a mess these sections turned out to be

#### iii. Do Rights exist

Rights contain knowledge about what we want, and what the people around us want. And, of course, of what we can make, and what the people around us can make. But that description is so vague, as to be true of virtually everything done by humans. Notably, it is also true of the question "where does an entrepreneur get his profits?", which I believe is no accident.

My view is descriptive -- it is that *all rights come from the landlord's mind*. The landlord (or anarchic non-landlord) imbues the land with a certain *attitude* (for lack of a better word). The owner of the land agrees to try to make certain kinds of Laws -- these Laws affect the ways which you can be treated, and the ways in which you are allowed to treat others.

In a monarchy, the King would own all the land, and Rights (and Laws) would come from him (for as long as he is in power).

Now, who is this all-important landlord? Well, personally I follow Henry George in believing that [the land belongs to everybody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George) (since no one produced it). So everyone is both tenant and landowner -- we must wonder "what does everyone around here want?". Hence the problem of governance. But under 

The endless [re-examination of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights#Definitional_issues), is just the landlord trying to make up his mind. In a large, diverse, complex country, the landlord will have to constantly make and re-make his mind. The endless re-framing and arguing about Rights, is just tenants trying to obtain more-favorable treatment from the landlord (as they should!).

In
#### iii. Are Rights Subjective?

We *use* rights in order to manage and direct a portfolio of laws, and of course to help measure the consent of the governed. In that way, they have a real impact on physical reality.

Even though Rights come from human brains (in this view), I believe that they are also exist objectively, in some (very mysterious) sense. Certainly, there are ways of reasoning about "what a group wants", vs "what you personally want" (for example Rawls' ["veil of ignorance"]()) -- although there doesn't seem to be any way of checking to make sure that you have understood "what it is like to be someone else" well-enough.

They come from the "sovereign", which is a fancy way of saying that they come from *the landlord's mind*. The landlord is in a certain mood

-->

#### iv. "Negative" Rights / Skyhook Governance

Anarchists attempt to take refuge in the so-called "negative rights", such as freedom of speech. Supposedly, no one needs to do anything in order to provide these rights. And so any government --even no government-- could supply negative-rights to the people in unlimited quantities. They could do so by simply doing nothing.

It is true that [Laws defending] these Rights are cheaper to [enforce], and their efficiency deserves our respect. But, unfortunately, such Law-enforcement is not free, either. Most fundamentally, the Rights are lost if a neighboring (or internal) tyrant finds it advantageous to invade, and loot the country in a Right-violating way.

If you endorsed the "non-aggression principle", for example, you would be unable to invade your neighbor's property -- but your neighbor would still be able to invade your property! NAP-advocates assume that they can choose rules for themselves (constraining their own behavior), and also *for other people*, against their will! But this just assumes away the problem of governance -- as if a rocket scientist assumed away the problem of escape velocity.

<!-- too political (ironically), but also too Deutsch-heavy

    People wring their hands
    and say that there must be
    "better ways of finding solutions"
    than warfare. Of course there are.
    ...
    But no way of finding solutions
    is so effective that it can work
    when it isn't being used.

--[David Deutsch](https://www.edge.org/documents/whatnow/whatnow_deutsch.html)
-->

For citizens to retain a set of Rights, they must retain a corresponding set of Laws -- no tyrannical Laws can be added, and no protective Laws can be removed. Thus, to retain a set of Rights, the sovereign (whoever that is) must remain in power. "Freedom isn't free", as the saying goes. (But, through innovation, we can make it cheaper over time.)

### Footnotes






<!--

### i. Good Government vs. Bad Government

Some governments really are better than others.

Above, I have argued that all societies [1] desire teamwork, and [2] face the task of consent-measurement. And that [3] they cannot ever succeed perfectly.

While, perfection is impossible, it *is* possible to do better or worse. When a government measures consent accurately and cheaply, it is promoting freedom and prosperity. When it measures consent poorly or inefficiently, it is instead a vehicle for tyranny and misery.

No government can succeed at its task perfectly, just as no entrepreneur can succeed at their task (to generate a return on capital) perfectly. Moreover, there is no "magic formula" that describes the optimal government one and for all, just as there is no such formula for describing the optimal business model once and for all.

Body cameras are an excellent example. They are useful for detecting police misconduct. A good government would pursue policies that [1] in the first place, allowed body cameras to be invented and become cheap, and [2] encourage their use in monitoring government-citizen interactions.

Often, people oppose "icky" policies, frigthening. "do you support drug legalization" or gay rights, people experience a panicked reaction. This biases the consensus.

People think that the king will agree with them. Which is very naive, of course. In principle it is no different from people who are worried about something and insist that "the goverment regulate it". Monarchy is just insisting that the goverment regulate everything. People often repeat the first mistake under democracy...they see a problem and they think that the government should get involved, because they assume that the government will behave has they will behave (projection). When a plan is in its initial vague stages, it is at its most agreeable.

It teaches us the same lesson: that the vote-measuring process[^n] must somehow be 'prior to' the government itself, if it is to mean anything.

if the government is to be bound by it.

[^n]: These principles do not only apply to elections. Stalin famously manipulated trials, as well -- making it seem as though the USSR was *indeed* surrounded by traitors and conspirators. In truth he controlled every aspect of these trials: the defendants were secretly tortured for days, given a script to read, and even drugged during their confessions.

Maybe one day someone will literally force people to read and sign a giant terms and conditions document, whenever they enter a country.

many of our norms are being violated -- survelliance state can be used to enforce laws; but we have norms against monitoring people (even our rivals) too closely; this hyper-survelliance allows us to hyper-enforce certain behavioral norms

In particular, we could give all prisoners the option to replace their sentence with permanent exile. This is in marked contrast to what we normally do, which is hold prisoners on bail.

The relevant factors counting against this are, if it is expensive to enforce border control, or expensive to keep checking on prisoners to await their latest decision, and the cost of physically transporting them to the border.


Elections are certainly not an optimal measure of consent. ardly the case  is a bit of a stretch to say that they have "the consent of the governed" behind them. I certainly prefer to believe that the drug war, minimum wage, and criminalization of homosexuality -- just flustered by the question, and fear of being associated with stigma [self-fullfilling prophecy].

If securing the border is cheap

ask everyone everything. voluntaryism just becomes a paralyzing beaurocracy .

The label of "Democracy" is too broadly defined. My emphasis is on specific consent-measuring-technologies (CMTs).

One way that "democracy" is too broad a term, is that it includes FPTP and PR. But those are very different.

Also, there are differences in suffrage.

How the vote is taken. In the US, for example,  it is always on a specific date -- a Tuesday in early November. This is because, when it was all invented, 95+% of the population were farmers, who attended Sunday mass. It was November to avoid harvest / snowfall; it was Tuesday so that it wouldn't interfere with church.

Furthermore, various population


In reality there are specific 

Suffrage
(Who participates?)

* 18 years+
* born in the country OR lived there for a while
* Not in prison


We get better at answering it all the time. Today, on Twitter, you can "mute" or "block" undesirables with a single click. In contrast, in 1666 London the chief firefighting technique was for firefighters to demolish neighbors' houses with large hooks.

### Constructor Theory

Earlier in this essay I mentioned "teamwork constructors".

Meditate on Constructor Theory as you read the following quotes:

    ...the liberals act as if
    well, if we didn't have government schools,
    then parents wouldn't educate their kids
    -- of course they would!
    You don't think they would send their kids to private schools?
    And they'd be a lot less expensive
    and you'd have all kinds of entrepreneurs
    trying to earn money
    trying to educate poor kids,
    just like people earn a lot of money
    clothing poor kids, and feeding poor kids,
    and housing them.
    I mean, if there's money to be made,
    then an entrepreneur is going to come in
    and satisfy that desire.

-- Peter Schiff on the Joe Rogan Experience ([2:04:55](https://youtu.be/by1OgqQQANg?t=7495))

Clearly a system of private schools would be superior. Instead I wish to focus on an issue that goes [back to Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_education#Plan_for_systematic_education): to what extent should taxpayers *pay* for nearby children's education (perhaps via [voucher system as advocated by Milton Friedman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=055faSi3D5E))? If so, *what* should the money be spent on, exactly? Why would we be suspicious of the entrepreneurs in this case?

The typical economic model (even the Austrian one), assumes that consumers know what they want, and what they can buy and how. They then make the selection that [they think] would best satisfy them.

Well, if you mislead someone, then you are in an excellent position to continue scamming them. Education is aspirational -- people seek it out, because they want to discard who they are right now, and become someone else.

Obviously, the issue with slavery, is that any society which permits it will have *apparent* coercion taking place everywhere
