I was musing on how to encourage miner-decentralization. It seemed that [this](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/) was among the better technical ideas out there. My weak opinion (which I hope is correct) is that eventually everyone will be using P2Pool and this problem will sort of die out, or that new blockchain structures ("fractal sidechains/treechains", to just throw some buzzwords out) will decrease the problem's relevance.

Of course, I really wanted a more econ-based idea. First, I tried to wrap my head around "measuring decentralization" and tried to make a list of the things which increase with decentralization:

* **Redundancy** of data-storage-and-generation-processes (if you killed 99.9% of English-speakers, the survivors could still teach it to someone else and then speak with them in English)
* Authoritative **Indifference** / Flat Hierarchy (English PhDs can't really prevent the creation of an 'internet dialect' which includes "LOL")
* **Privacy** of Agents (from one single place, it is impossible to know who currently is using English)


It seemed that that only real insight I could draw from this, was a rather dark one: constantly seek out the "most-popular mining-computer" and destroy it! This would encourage miners never to grow so large as to become visible.

Pretty impractical, unfortunately. But, in a small irony, the laws of thermodynamics have taken a small step in this direction, where [a mining setup was so large that it produced enough heat to literally self-destruct](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2lexl2/here_is_why_the_hash_rate_jumped_and_took_a_dive/).

Will we ever see the day when a small Rebel Alliance  attacks a gigantic mining facility by compromising its thermal exhaust ports?
