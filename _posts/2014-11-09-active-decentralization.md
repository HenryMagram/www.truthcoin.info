### The Problem

I was musing on how to encourage miner-decentralization. It seemed that [this](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/) was among the better technical ideas out there. My weak opinion (which I hope is correct) is that eventually everyone will be using P2Pool and this problem will sort of die out, or that new blockchain structures will decrease the problem's relevance.

### Covariates

Of course, I really wanted a more econ-based idea. First, I tried to wrap my head around "measuring decentralization" and tried to make a list of the things which increase with decentralization:

* **Redundancy** of data-storage-and-generation-processes (if you killed 99.9% of English-speakers, the survivors could still teach it to someone else and then speak with them in English)
* Authoritative **Indifference** / Flat Hierarchy (English PhDs can't really prevent the creation of an 'internet dialect' which includes "LOL")
* **Privacy** of Agents (from one single place, it is impossible to know who currently is using English)


It seemed that that only real insight I could draw from this, was a rather dark one: constantly seek out the "most-popular mining-computer" and destroy it! This would encourage miners never to grow so large as to become visible.

Pretty impractical, unfortunately. But, in a small irony, the laws of thermodynamics have taken a small step in this direction, where [a mining setup was so large that it produced enough heat to literally self-destruct](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2lexl2/here_is_why_the_hash_rate_jumped_and_took_a_dive/).

Will we ever see the day when a small Rebel Alliance attacks a gigantic mining facility by compromising its thermal exhaust ports?

### Our Active Alternatives

I think that this "active" campaign to find and destroy miners may be *the only way* to actively increase *mining* decentralization, assuming you wanted to do such a thing (which I don't, really... mining decentralization is not Bitcoin decentralization).

After all, fundamentally, the only difference between "a coordinated group" and "an uncoordinated group" is that *something* (coordination) *has been removed*. The coordinated group can always do everything the uncoordinated group can do (and more). So how are you going to make life harder for one but not the other?

### Passive Decentralization

Passively, the difficulty-adjustment process works to constantly eliminate the least-profitable miners, making the group more and more homogenous over time. However, (as pointed out by many people), geographically dispersed sources of minimal-cost power (provided by [hydro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hydro#Growth) / [solar](http://rationalconspiracy.com/2012/10/21/a-new-plan-for-solar-energy/) in remote areas) will restore some *geographic* decentralization (which may, or may not, be related to ownership/control).
