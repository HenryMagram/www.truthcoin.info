### Project Has Moved, Blog Remains

Hello! A project and a blog once lived here. Now, by popular demand, my project has [changed its name to Hivemind and found a new home](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/). (All old hyperlinks will continue to work.)

Still, this blog remains!

### It's a great blog.

Consistently winning praise, retweets, and upvotes from Bitcoin Experts around the web, this blog is famous for getting the "last word" on topics such as:

* Why Proof of Stake [isn't cheaper](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest), and [isn't better](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-and-mining) than Proof of Work.
* [Why Smart Contracts are Bad for Bitcoin, but Oracles are Good](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains), and [How to Fix Smart Contracts](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/wise-contracts/).
* [When blockchains are useful, from First Principles.](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/limits-of-blockchain/)
* [Bitcoin and Deflation - Why the focus on macro is a waste of time.](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deflation-the-last-word)
* [Fraud Proofs -- supposedly "impossible"](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/fraud-proofs/)!
* Decentralization - [how to measure it](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization) and how to [increase it](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/active-decentralization).
* The [best kind of privacy](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/) is also the simplest, and already availiable.
* ...and much more!

### What's the Point?

My interests are uses of P2P blockchain technology (ie, blockchains without a mailing address), and in how blockchain-users can resolve disputes over what the blockchain should contain or do.

Although most attempts to use Bitcoin beyond payments have failed horribly, I have my own non-Bitcoin Blockchain-project [here](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/)!
