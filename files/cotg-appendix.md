### Appendix: Rights

This was originally Part 3, Section D. But it isn't relevant to the conclusion, so I moved it here.

#### i. Laws vs Rights

Just as laws "advise" people on how to behave, Rights "advise" laws on what they should say.

<!-- somewhat like the difference between Ethics and Morals -->

Whereas Laws are specific, concrete, numerous, contain exceptions, and are occasionally revised or removed, Rights are general, abstract, few in number, contain very few exceptions, and are almost never revised or removed.

In this sense, Rights are a kind of Platonic Ideal toward which the individual imperfect Laws strive. We can evaluate a portfolio of laws, based on how well they serve a set of Rights.

#### ii. From where do we get our rights?

The opening quotation of this essay claimed that it was "self-evident" that men were endowed with "unalienable Rights" to Life and Liberty. But this cannot be literally true. Since the document's publication in 1776, nearly all the Americans living under its protection have died (against their will), at some point or another. So the Right to Life was de facto alienable. Worse, the quotation says that rights came from "[our] Creator" -- first introducing theology into the equation, but second implying that if Creator changed His mind, we would then lose all of our rights. And that doesn't seem to make any sense either. So we cannot take the Declaration's advice in this case.

Some people feel that Rights need to be "derived from" something. But this also doesn't seem to be true. The things we *build*, are constructed using tools and ingredients that almost never resemble the final product. And the things we *want* certainly don't seem to be "derived from" anything nearby (people just 'get hungry', whether they think about it or not) -- and if someone *wanted* to want something new (ie, a want not derived from a previous want), it isn't clear why this should be 'prohibited' (or whatever).

#### iii. Rights are Objective Norms

In my view, Rights (the real ones that we actually get in reality) are just *objective norms*. They are behavioral guidelines that are near-universally endorsed. When a group of people is pretty sure that they *all* want the group to behave a certain way, then you have a Right. This is why Rights need to be simple, uncontroversial, few in number, containing few exceptions, etc.

It is also why it is strategically advantageous to *say* that a hypothetical new Right has been "derived from" something that's already popular and well-known (such as God), even if in fact it wasn't -- the supporters of the new Right won't care enough to even look into it in the first place, and the detractors will be hung up on trying to refute the derivation (and since all refutations are arguments, the supporters can just pretend that they weren't convinced -- so it costs them nothing).

Since Rights should apply universally ([independently of a person's individual situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position)), we should be able to discover them over time, the same way we discover the laws of physics. We should also be able to discover *faster ways of discovering the best Rights*. 

<!-- what a mess these sections turned out to be

#### iii. Do Rights exist

Rights contain knowledge about what we want, and what the people around us want. And, of course, of what we can make, and what the people around us can make. But that description is so vague, as to be true of virtually everything done by humans. Notably, it is also true of the question "where does an entrepreneur get his profits?", which I believe is no accident.

My view is descriptive -- it is that *all rights come from the landlord's mind*. The landlord (or anarchic non-landlord) imbues the land with a certain *attitude* (for lack of a better word). The owner of the land agrees to try to make certain kinds of Laws -- these Laws affect the ways which you can be treated, and the ways in which you are allowed to treat others.

In a monarchy, the King would own all the land, and Rights (and Laws) would come from him (for as long as he is in power).

Now, who is this all-important landlord? Well, personally I follow Henry George in believing that [the land belongs to everybody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George) (since no one produced it). So everyone is both tenant and landowner -- we must wonder "what does everyone around here want?". Hence the problem of governance. But under 

The endless [re-examination of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights#Definitional_issues), is just the landlord trying to make up his mind. In a large, diverse, complex country, the landlord will have to constantly make and re-make his mind. The endless re-framing and arguing about Rights, is just tenants trying to obtain more-favorable treatment from the landlord (as they should!).

In
#### iii. Are Rights Subjective?

We *use* rights in order to manage and direct a portfolio of laws, and of course to help measure the consent of the governed. In that way, they have a real impact on physical reality.

Even though Rights come from human brains (in this view), I believe that they are also exist objectively, in some (very mysterious) sense. Certainly, there are ways of reasoning about "what a group wants", vs "what you personally want" (for example Rawls' ["veil of ignorance"]()) -- although there doesn't seem to be any way of checking to make sure that you have understood "what it is like to be someone else" well-enough.

They come from the "sovereign", which is a fancy way of saying that they come from *the landlord's mind*. The landlord is in a certain mood

#### iv. "Negative" Rights / Skyhook Governance

Anarchists attempt to take refuge in the so-called "negative rights", such as freedom of speech. Supposedly, no one needs to do anything in order to provide these rights. And so any government --even no government-- could supply negative-rights to the people in unlimited quantities. They could do so by simply doing nothing.

It is true that [Laws defending] these Rights are cheaper to [enforce], and their efficiency deserves our respect. But, unfortunately, such Law-enforcement is not free, either. Most fundamentally, the Rights are lost if a neighboring (or internal) tyrant finds it advantageous to invade, and loot the country in a Right-violating way.

If you endorsed the "non-aggression principle", for example, you would be unable to invade your neighbor's property -- but your neighbor would still be able to invade your property! NAP-advocates assume that they can choose rules for themselves (constraining their own behavior), and also *for other people*, against their will! But this just assumes away the problem of governance -- as if a rocket scientist assumed away the problem of escape velocity.

<!-- too political (ironically), but also too Deutsch-heavy

    People wring their hands
    and say that there must be
    "better ways of finding solutions"
    than warfare. Of course there are.
    ...
    But no way of finding solutions
    is so effective that it can work
    when it isn't being used.

For citizens to retain a set of Rights, they must retain a corresponding set of Laws -- no tyrannical Laws can be added, and no protective Laws can be removed. Thus, to retain a set of Rights, the sovereign (whoever that is) must remain in power. "Freedom isn't free", as the saying goes. (But, through innovation, we can make it cheaper over time.)
