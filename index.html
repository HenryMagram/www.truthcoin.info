<h1>What is Truthcoin?</h1>

<p>
You can do two things with money: <b>spend</b> it or <b>invest</b> it. Bitcoin was about spending, Truthcoin is about investing (and much, much more)!
</p>

<p>
Check out <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/six-slide-sprint.pdf">Truthcoin in Six Slides</a> for an introduction, and <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/what-is-truthcoin.pdf">What is Truthcoin?</a> for a little more detail, then hit the documents on the right!
</p>

<p>
Basically, we're talking about:
<ul>
  <li>Blockchain Prediction Markets</li>
  <li>BitUSD (Betting on Dollars to make a CryptoDollar)</li>
  <li>Smart Contracts</li>
  <li>Within-Protocol Colored Coins</li>
  <li>A Second Scientific Revolution</li>
  <li>...and more!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I wish I had more time to explain...but I have a ton of Truthcoin-paper editing to do! Unfortunately (as <a href="http://economics.yale.edu/people/william-d-nordhaus">my employer</a> will tell you) I'm a very slow writer, and someone with precious little free time.
