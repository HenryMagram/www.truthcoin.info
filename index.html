<h1>What is Truthcoin?</h1>


<h2>The Second Half of Money</h2>

<p>
Bitcoin let you <b>spend</b> <u>without asking for anyone's permission</u>, Truthcoin tries to do the same for <b>investing</b>.
</p>

<p>
If you have about 15 seconds before leaving: <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/six-slide-sprint.pdf">Truthcoin in Six Slides</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you've never even heard of Bitcoin before: <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/what-is-truthcoin.pdf">What is Truthcoin?</a> (10 fun slides) to learn about what you've been missing this whole time.
</p>

<p>
Then hit the documents on the right, starting with: <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/1_Purpose.pdf">Why do this?</a>
</p>


<h2>A "Free Lunch" for Bitcoin</h2>

<p>
Planned to be <u>tested</u> and <u>released</u> as a <b>hard fork</b> or <b>sidechain</b> of Bitcoin (or Ethereum / Automated Transactions contract honoring BTC balances). Keep one coin, or both, or neither...whatever you want! Traditional SHA256 merged-mining for the same reason.
</p>

<h2>A Tasty Lunch</h2>
<p>
The goal of this project is to get <b>external data into the blockchain</b> reliably, and use that data <b>efficiently</b> and <b>conservatively</b>.
</p>

<p>
Basically, we're talking:
<ul>
  <li>Blockchain Prediction Markets</li>
  <li>BitUSD (Speculating on Dollars to produce a CryptoDollar)</li>
  <li>Smart Contracts</li>
  <li>Within-Protocol Colored Coins</li>
  <li>Trustless Dominant Assurance Contracts</li>
  <li>...and more!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Try to imagine:
<ul>
  <li>The network effect of <b>Bitcoin</b>...</li>
  
  <li>...the betting feeds of <b>Counterparty</b> without having to trust the feed-operator to broadcast honestly...</li>
  <li>...the programmable flexibility of <b>Ethereum</b>, with much less complexity...</li>
  <li>...the BitAssets of <b>BitsharesX</b>, but done right (no soviet-style price fixing, or fiat 'name only' assets, and no swapping out the tried-and-true security model with what someone had for breakfast today)...</li>
  
  <li>...definitely none of the network-effect-killing 100%-premine of <b>NXT</b> (what??)...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b>Peercoin</b>'s proof of stake (because proof of stake is insecure and pointless, and Peercoin is consequentially proof-of-work anyway)...</li>

  <li>...the fun of <b>Dogecoin</b> (for me, anyway)...</li>
  
  <li>...none of the organizational awkwardness / Byzantine-fault-intolerance of <b>Ripple</b>...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b>Litecoin</b>, The Great BitcoinTalk Failure...</li>
  
  <li>...plus near-instant-speed share-trading with the ease of a single Bitcoin tx!</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
And finally, I am planning to start a blog here, to give this project some context, and heavily criticize the microeconomics of rivial cryptocoin projects, as most contain (or are based on) the purest nonsense. I hope to take criticism in return!
