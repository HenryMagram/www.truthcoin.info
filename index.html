<h1>What is Truthcoin?</h1>

<p>
Truthcoin is my ambitious project to create a trustless P2P prediction-marketplace. This is possible because, unlike most marketplaces, the end product of
a prediction market (PM) is information. Bitcoin adds the second piece of the puzzle: the exchange of value. The end result is the first of its kind: a
market for actual prediction-commodities, which have a value based on their accuracy and not based on the behaviour of any administrator, rival trader, or
counterparty.
</p>

<p>
Traditional PMs have been persecuted much in the same way as e-cash systems, and current Bitcoin alternatives require the user to trust the operator to 1]
keep funds safe, 2] create desirable markets, and 3] correctly determine the outcome of markets.
</p>

<p>
Contract outcomes are determined in a trustless and decentralized way, through a weighted vote based on present and past consensus with a unique Nash
Equilibrium where all voters report accurately on the state of markets. Incentives are to only create contracts which are useful (measured by trading
volume), and unambiguous (measured by vote-similarity). Additionally, market liquidity (a frequent problem) is guaranteed to be permanently nonzero thanks
to the LMSR, an invention of Dr. Robin Hanson. The LMSR's use of an update rule instead of actual Buy/Ask trading greatly simplifies implementation, while
allowing for realtime buying and selling.
