<h1>What is Truthcoin?</h1>


<h2>Contracts as Smart as Whatever's Reading Them</h2>

<p>
Truthcoin attempts to create a <b>trustless oracle</b>, which reliably absorbs accurate data into a blockchain for use in <b>Prediction Markets</b>. These markets have many <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">applications</a> (which include superior alternatives to Lighthouse, Counterparty/Medici, BitsharesX, and Ethereum) and have the potential to revolutionize the way information is created and spread.
</p>

<p>
If you've never even heard of Bitcoin before, try <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/what-is-truthcoin.pdf">What is Truthcoin?</a> (10 fun slides) to learn about what you've been missing this whole time.
</p>

<p>
Then hit the documents on the right, starting with: <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/1_Purpose.pdf">Why do this?</a>
</p>


<h2>A "Free Lunch" for Bitcoin</h2>

<p>
Planned to be a <a href="http://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">sidechain</a> of Bitcoin. This means that you can use Bitcoin to take advantage of Truthcoin's features (to create markets and trade in them). A separate coin is used solely to power the trustless oracle (to eliciting honest reports about market-outcomes).

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>
Speaking technically, this project aims to get <b>external data into the blockchain</b> reliably, and use that data <b><u>efficiently</u></b> and <b><u>conservatively</u></b>.
</p>

<p>
However, unlike in other blockchain projects, the ultimate purpose(s) is NOT to establish a new payment system (or delude the innocent with get-rich-quick nonsense), but instead to revolutionize the way information is created and spread, by...
<ul>
  <li>...kickin' off a new scientific revolution...</li>
  <li>...overhauling democratic governance (deemphasizing showmanship, firing the PR-staff, highlighting the irrelevance of race/gender/who-candidate-has-slept-with)...</li>
  <li>...hugely <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/04/rah-manic-monopolists.html">increasing economic growth</a>...</li>
  <li>...providing a novel way to efficiently fund public goods, without taxation or coercion...</li>
  <li>...cutting out all Wall St. / banking middlemen and replacing them with tech...</li>
  <li>...spearheading the campaign to make Bitcoin the world's internet currency...</li>
  <li>...and <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">more</a>!</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
Try to imagine:
<ul>
  <li>The network effect of <b><u>Bitcoin</b></u>...</li>
  
  <li>...the betting feeds of <b><u>Counterparty</b></u>, without having to trust the feed-operator to broadcast honestly...</li>
  <li>...the programmable flexibility of <b><u>Ethereum</b></u>, with much less complexity...</li>
  <li>...the BitAssets of <b><u>BitsharesX</b></u>, but <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/bitusd/">done right</a> (no soviet-style price fixing, or fiat 'name only' assets, and no swapping out the tried-and-true security model with what someone had for breakfast today)...</li>
  
  <li>...definitely none of the network-effect-killing 100%-premine of <b><u>NXT</b></u> (what??)...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b><u>Peercoin</b></u>'s proof of stake (because <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-and-mining/">proof of stake is insecure and pointless</a>, and Peercoin is consequentially proof-of-work anyway)...</li>

  <li>...the fun of <b><u>Dogecoin</b></u> (for me, anyway)...</li>
  
  <li>...none of the organizational awkwardness / Byzantine-fault-intolerance of <b><u>Ripple</b></u>...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b><u>Litecoin</b></u>, The Great BitcoinTalk Failure...</li>
  
  <li>...plus near-instant-speed share-trading with the ease of a single Bitcoin tx!</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
And finally, I am planning to start a blog here, to give this project some context, and heavily criticize the microeconomics of rivial cryptocoin projects, as most contain (or are based on) the purest nonsense. I hope to take criticism in return!
