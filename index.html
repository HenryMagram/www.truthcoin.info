<h1>What is Truthcoin?</h1>


<h2>Bitcoin "Smart Contracts" (as Smart as Whatever's Reading Them)</h2>

<p>
Truthcoin is a <b>Peer to Peer Oracle Protocol</b> which absorbs accurate data into a blockchain so that Bitcoin-users can speculate in <b>Prediction Markets</b>. These markets have many <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">applications</a> (which include superior alternatives to Lighthouse, Counterparty, Medici, Bitshares, and Ethereum) and have the potential to revolutionize the emergance and diffusion of knowledge in society.
</p>

<p>
If you've never even heard of Bitcoin before, try <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/what-is-truthcoin.pdf">What is Truthcoin?</a> (10 fun slides) to learn about what you've been missing this whole time.

Then hit the <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/">papers</a> and <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/">presentations</a>, starting with: <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/1_Purpose.pdf">Why do this?</a>. Feel free to browse the <a href="https://dev.truthcoin.info/">dev section</a> or the <a href="http://forum.truthcoin.info/">forums</a>.

<h2>Bitcoin Maximal</h2>

<p>
Planned to be a <a href="http://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">sidechain</a> of Bitcoin. This means that Bitcoin (and only Bitcoin) is used to create and trade in Markets. A separate coin-type does some pretty fancy things to ensure that a group of self-selected, anonymous, greedy users will always resolve the contract-outcomes honestly.

<h2>The Goal: Scientific Revolution Part II</h2>
<p>
Speaking technically, this project aims to get <b>external data into a blockchain</b> reliably, and use that data <b><u>efficiently</u></b> and <b><u>conservatively</u></b>.
</p>

<p>
However, unlike other blockchain-projects, the ultimate purpose is <b>NOT to establish a new payment system</b> (nor to delude the innocent with get-rich-quick nonsense), but instead to...

<ul>
  <li>...revolutionize <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/info-problems.pdf">the way information is created and spread</a>, giving the internet a "frontal lobe"...</li>
  <li>...overhaul <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">democratic governance</a> (deemphasizing showmanship/PR, highlighting the irrelevance of race/gender/who-candidate-has-slept-with)...</li> 
  <li>...<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/04/rah-manic-monopolists.html">boost economic growth</a>...</li>
  <li>...provide <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">a novel way to efficiently fund public goods</a>, without taxation or coercion...</li>
  <li>...cut out all Wall St. / banking middlemen and replace them with <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf">tech</a>...</li>
  <li>...spearhead the campaign to make Bitcoin the world's internet currency...</li>
  <li>...and <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">more</a>!</li>
</ul>
</p>


<!-- This section was fun when Truthcoin was completely new and undiscovered, but now that people are talking about it it just seems almost acrimonious.

<h2>The Barren Competitive Landscape</h2>

<p>
Try to imagine:
<ul>
  <li>The network effect of <b><u>Bitcoin</b></u>...</li>
  
  <li>...the betting feeds of <b><u>Counterparty</b></u>, without <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/presentations/truthcoin-outcomes.pdf">having to trust the feed-operator</a> to broadcast honestly...</li>
  <li>...the programmable flexibility of <b><u>Ethereum</b></u>, with much less <a href="http://forum.truthcoin.info/index.php/topic,184.msg947.html#msg947">complexity</a>...</li>
  <li>...the BitAssets of <b><u>BitsharesX</b></u>, but <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/bitusd/">done right</a> (no soviet-style price fixing, or fiat 'name only' assets, and no swapping out the tried-and-true security model with what someone had for breakfast today)...</li>
  
  <li>...definitely none of the network-effect-killing 100%-premine of <b><u>NXT</b></u> (what??)...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b><u>Peercoin</b></u>'s proof of stake (because <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-and-mining/">proof of stake is insecure and pointless</a>, and Peercoin is consequentially proof-of-work anyway)...</li>

  <li>...the fun of <b><u>Dogecoin</b></u> (for me, anyway)...</li>
  
  <li>...none of the <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/pdf/20150505.pdf">organizational awkwardness</a> / <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9342348">Byzantine-fault-intolerance</a> of <b><u>Ripple</b></u>...</li>
  <li>...nothing whatsoever to do with <b><u>Litecoin</b></u>, The Great BitcoinTalk Failure...</li>
  
  <li>...plus near-instant-speed share-trading with the ease of a single Bitcoin tx!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bitcoin Projects I Like</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a> and <a href="https://purse.io/">Purse.Io</a> meet even my high standards, as they reveal inefficencies in traditional payment systems and send those savings to you, the user (as does <a href="https://www.gyft.com/bitcoin/">Gyft</a>). This is the so-called "fundamental value" of Bitcoin, end of story.</p>
<p>I imagined Bitcoin's 'killer app' to be something that would turn all phones and computers into ISPs as well as internet users, and make the internet fully private, cheap, and efficient (with too many benefits to list). <a href="https://www.bitmesh.network/">BitMesh</a> is working on something which might become this (as is <a href="https://oniontip.com/">OnionTip</a> to some extent).</p>
<p>For Bitcoin wallets, I recommend <a href="https://electrum.org/#home"> Electrum</a> (starting it up with the internet off [or on a really old laptop], writing down the 12 word seed, encrypting the seed with a huge passphrase [which you can immediately forget], reconnecting the internet, emailing yourself your new BTC addresses [which you watch from <a href="https://blockchain.info/"> Blockchain.info</a>], and finally erasing the installation completely). I also recommend the concept of Hardware Wallets, but I lack the CS expertise required to make a specific recommendation (although the Trezor looks good).</p>
