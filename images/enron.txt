Excerpts:

00:22:15	>> Jeff was like the prophet.
00:22:17	He came in and said there's a whole new world out there.
00:22:19	Forget about this pipeline stuff, ..
00:22:26	We can recreate this entire industry.
..
00:22:38	>> The excitement was palpable.
00:22:45	You cannot imagine how proud we all were to be there, and then, of course, we had a leader who imbued us with a sense of confidence that if we were smart, anything could be accomplished, and in the bottom line we began to make money, and that in and of itself was a reaffirmation that this could be big.

...

00:28:06	>> They pitched it almost as an economic religion.
00:28:11	>> Enron online will change the markets for many, many commodities.
00:28:17	It is creating an open, transparent marketplace that replaces the dark blind system that existed.
00:28:25	It is simple.
00:28:26	You turn on your computer, and it's right there.
00:28:28	That's our vision.
00:28:29	We're trying to change the world.

...

00:50:56	>> Just last week, enron captivated wall street with its bold move into broadband, teaming up with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand.
00:51:04	>> It was like being at a religious cult meeting.
00:51:08	People started jumping up from their seats with their cell phones and their blackberrys, running out to the halls to call their bosses.
00:51:18	>> One analyst summed up his recommendation to investors: "wow." enron's stock soared 34% in two days.
00:51:27	>> And you can tell from the response in the stock market that they like the strategy, it makes sense.
00:51:35	>> They announced they had developed the technology.
00:51:38	It would be in test markets by the end of the year.
00:51:41	>> And the technology works.
00:51:42	The quality is great and the customers like it.
00:51:47	So, we've made a lot of progress.
00:51:51	>> The truth was that enron was just struggling with the technology for video on demand.
00:51:56	>> The technology didn't work and the deal with blockbuster soon collapsed.

...

00:58:50	>> We were the poster child for the new economy.
00:58:54	We had this culture that had a lot of focus on reminding us how good we were.
00:58:57	And as that culture emerged, then we get to "fortune" magazine telling us we were the most innovative corporation in america.
00:59:02	Then we *really* began to feel good about ourselves.
