To whom it may concern,

My name is Paul Sztorc, I am a prominent Bitcoin researcher and
technologist.

According to some, the ASICBOOST patent is currently be causing
problems for the Bitcoin ecosystem. One way to make this headache go
away, would be for someone to purchase the patent (in full) and, as a
gesture of charity, place ASICBOOST into the public domain.

Please think carefully - the patent may be worthless if the Core
Developers alter the Bitcoin software so that ASICBoost cannot be used
(which is precisely what many influential developers intend to do).
Moreover, it is obvious that an overwhelming portion of miners (often
situated in China) are already ignoring the patent and intend to do so
in the future. As a direct result, these miners may drive competitors
out of business, at which point *all* active Bitcoin miners would be
using ASICboost, for free...in which case the patent is, again, worthless.

However, I have rich friends who may want to bury this issue for
political reasons. You may be able to profit handsomely from an
otherwise worthless patent, purely as a result of short-lived political
circumstances.

If you are interested, please let me know your expectations.

Thank you for your time,
Paul
