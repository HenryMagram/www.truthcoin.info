Zcash in its regular form, is not meta-private.


Zcash is only meta-private as a sidechain



For payments, Zcash is not meta-private, because your use of a more cumbersome and expensive transaction is both [1] suspicious and [2] a fact that is publicly known.

For mixing coins, Zcash is meta-private because you end up with regular "vanilla" coins. It is like a gigantic 3-month-long CoinJoin

In fact, you probably end up totally unrelated layer-1 coins, sent to you by *Andreas*, proprietor of SideShift.
