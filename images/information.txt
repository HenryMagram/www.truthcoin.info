( McLuhan/Postman notwithstanding, information retains its quality reguardless of what it is 'written on'. By this, I mean that the concept of "3" can exist digitally in a computer, or as Roman Numerals "III" chiseled into marble, or as the word "three" on paper, or as Latin prefix "tri-" spoken aloud. It's all the same three. )
