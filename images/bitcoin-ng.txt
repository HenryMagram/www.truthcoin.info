Bitcoin-NG: "N"ot "G"ood Enough

Sept 10, 2016 - v 0.1


Introduction
---------------

Bitcoin-NG is a proposal to alter Bitcoin in two ways:
* [Flipped Work] Use PoW to select a 'leader', who later includes txns (via signatures) until a new leader is chosen.
* [Fraud Proofs] Prevent the broadcasting of invalid 0-conf txns, by holding revenues hostage, for a while.

Immediately, it is worse for scaling, in that it requires more information be broadcast across the P2P network:
* 1 additional Public Key, per Leader-block.
* 1 additional Signature, per tx-block.
* More blocks in general, and -therefore- more headers.
* (If not predefined), parameters for thee fee-split, per leader block (or, worse, per-tx).

It is also more novel, and more complex.

Do the benefits outweigh these drawbacks?


Benefits
----------

Supposedly, NG improves upon BTC in three ways:
1. "Fairness"           - Do small miners get their 'fair' share of txns (or disproportionately few)?
2. "Mining Utilization" - Do miners waste hashpower on stale / orphaned blocks?
3. "Time to Win"        - How long does it take to resolve forks?

These three are, in fact, the same problem: that miners who encounter a foreign block, must hold off on mining it, until they've downloaded and verified it; however, miners who find their own block already know that it is valid, and can continue to mine on it immediately. This 'speed benefit' triggers whenever a miner finds a block -- since large miners find blocks more often, it disproportionately favors larger miners.

Ie, large miners find it easier to "double block" if the blocks are large. They can find the first, and work on the second while everyone else is playing catch-up.

Bitcoin-NG proposes a way to solve this very real problem. In that way it is good.


SPV Mining
--------------

Unfortunately for NG, the very same problem had already been solved, months earlier. Matt Corallo's relay network was a contribution, but the major factor was the rise of "SPV mining" (headers-only validation). In fact, in July 2015, some SPV miners caused a notable PoW fork. The July 2015 date is significant for two reasons: [1] it was months before Scaling Montreal, and the debut of NG (ie, the authors should have been aware of SPV-m), and [2] July 2015 is months *after* Feb 2010 (the date of Bitcoin client 0.10.0 -- which is what NG compared itself to...ie, the NG authors used an out-of-date Bitcoin client).

Notice the rise, and fall, of orphaned blocks: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks?daysAverageString=30&timespan=all

...despite the fact that the blocksize/tx-load increased continuously throughout this period.

Sergio Demian Lerner was making the case *for* SPV mining, as early as March 2014: https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/spv-mining-is-the-solution-not-the-problem/

With SPV mining, block headers propagate ~instantly, solving Benefits [2] and [3] optimally.

In other words, most of the NG paper is about a problem that had already stopped existing. 

However, SPV Mining isn't perfect -- it does *not* solve the fact that txns must eventually propagate.

( Miners cannot include new txns, until they know that these txns are *NOT* double-spends [of a yet-to-be-downloaded block]. Many researchers, therefore, focused on tx-propagation for Scaling II, and presented IBLTs, Near Blocks, etc. After segwit/Lightning, this was the most popular scaling theme, for that conference. It so happens that, in practice, many of today's miners have gone even as far as to construct a shared mempool [enforced by personal relationships]. )

Scaling researchers decided that a simpler focus -on tx-propagation itself- was more fruitful than pursuing NG.

Why?


Similarities to Original Bitcoin
---------------------------------

Some similarities:
* There is almost no difference between NG's "included txns" and BTC's "0-conf" txns. 
* Miners can, still, only build on top of txns they have downloaded and validated.
* Miners already lose 100% of block revenue, if they include invalid txns.

These similarities make NG less relevant to Bitcoin users. 

A user who receives BTC, still has to wonder if the tx-block (or key-block), will be orphaned or rolled back. Therefore, NG's main benefit, to users, is the security of 0-conf txns. This benefit is trivial for many reasons: [a] 0-conf is currently "secure enough", [b] individuals are always free to require as many confs as they wish, and [c] LN will replace this problem in its entirety.

Secondly, NG doesn't remove the propagation requirement. It *does*, helpfully, allow download/verification to happen in real-time (instead of in short bursts), and it is similar to IBLTs / near blocks / ongoing tx-propagation research.



Fee-Splitting Flaw
--------------------

The "fee splitting" concept is not incentive compatible. A miner will always prefer to have 100% of the tx-fees, vs 40%, and a miner 100%-controls which messages are in-or-out of the chain.

Even in a hypothetical world where there are two miners, with equal hashrate, who always alternate blocks...

...(assuming X,Y represents X='period 1 revenue', and Y='period 2 revenue')...

         Leader:     A       B       A       B       A       B          * Totals *        
------------------------------------------------------------------        A    B
Follow NG Strat: | 40,60 | 40,60 | 40,60 | 40,60 | 40,60 | 40,60 |    = (300, 300)
Don't Follow:    | 40,60 | 40,60 | 40,60 | 100,0 | 100,0 | 100,0 |    = (240, 360)

...so, if one miner can (permanently) shift the world from 40-60 world to 100-0 world, he has a reason to do so.

If the protocol forces the fees to be split, 40-60, a miner can circumvent the protocol, by announcing a Bitcoin address, and requiring users to pay him/her directly. This is overwhelmingly trivial, as he can authenticate himself using the coinbase address and/or public key _he just broadcast_ with the keyblock. To comply, user's wallet software just needs a simple tuneup.

The NG authors responded to this, noting:
1. "a user does not gain a significant advantage by doing so"
2. "[it] reduces the motivation of future miners to mine on this microblock"
3. "subsequent leaders will have no motivation to place the transaction"

Of these three, the 1st and 3rd are false:
1. Any gains the miner enjoys, provide him with a "budget", which he can use to bribe users (by offering them lower fees). Fees are currently negligible, but this will change in the future.
3. Miners/pools can pre-declare permanent addresses...at which point, users can create multiple tx-versions, which subsequent leaders are equally-motivated to include.

As for the 2nd, the current leader can include 'fees' in each tx-block. To make these payments, he can use [1] anyone-can-spend outputs, or [2] a previously-sourced BTC address.

It is not necessary that these payments exceed 60% of the epoch's tx fees. For subsequent miners can be motivated, not merely by fee payment (call it, 'e'), but also by the revenue of the next block (100%-e). Moreover, once a leader-miner has begun this strategy, the choices available to rival miners are 'e' or nothing.

Hence, a permanent transition: originally miners got 100 (40+60), now they get 100 (100-e, +e).

"NG Ideal" --> "Some Users Cheat on Fees (with Some Miners)" --> "All Users Cheat on Fees (with All Miners)"

At a constant 100 revenue per block (in the process, assuming miners fee-maximize all blocks, and each block is of optimal size), miners will be indifferent to their post-transition world. The exception will be the miner who causes the transition(s) -- he profits.

Since all (100%) miners have a reason to transition, they might *all* [1] include all txns, and [2] extend each longest chain. 

Negative consequences:
* More bandwidth required, to send each txn, for no reason. (In BTC, tx fees are blank/implied, in NG they'd need to be specified with a 20-byte address.)
* Pointless redundant payments (from users to miners, then 'e' from miner to miner).
* Obfuscation of tx fees. As a result, Section 4.5 "Microblock Fork Prevention" (which relies on draining a miners tx-fees) is no longer valid.
* With s4.5 invalid, it is again possible for leaders to arbitrarily re-write tx-blocks (largely defeating the point of NG).


Nice Things About Bitcoin-NG
------------------------------

If NG worked, it would only pay miners if they jumped two hurdles: [1] produce hashes, and [2] get each tx from themselves out to all other miners.

It was probably discovered independently from SPV mining / tx propagation tech, and suffered from the slow pace of academia.


Conclusion
-----------

NG is an interesting take on some of Bitcoin's most fundamental challenges. Unfortunately, these challenges have simpler solutions (which, in many cases, are already in place). Moreover, the attempt to separate tx-fees from tx-inclusion creates an incentive problem -- when this problem is resolved, Bitcoin-NG regresses to an inefficient version of Bitcoin Original.
