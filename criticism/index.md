I look forward to filling this section. **Please help by offering your constructive criticism.**

## Can we test your resolution-algorithm empirically? You are asking users to accept a few significant sources of uncertainty at once. 

Someone is already trying to do that (and are using [my notes here](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/tree/master/lib/qualtrics), if anyone else wants to try and get this set up). Although the folder is labeled Qualtrics, I believe the current plan is to use Mechanical Turk (following the Harvard study at PeerPrediction.pdf).

If two or more people could do it, that would be fantastic!
