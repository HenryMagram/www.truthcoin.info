### Note: I Didn't Write These

There is no 'official' team, or anything approaching an official software release. I maintain [reference functions here in R](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin), and then translate them into Python and C++ in my spare time (aka rarely).

That said, a few individuals have tried to implement a working version of the software. I will put the best attempts here.

Please keep in mind that the software designers may have complex goals, ie, they may be working only on a demo, and not a battle-hardened stable release.
