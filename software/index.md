### Hub and Spoke

As of February 2015, there are a few teams who have contacted me for help with implementing the Truthcoin protocol.

I offer all of them free advice...it isn't always followed (which might surprise you).

At any rate, I look forward to linking to the winning team(s) here when they are finished. Dramatically, all plan to finish their coding work around April-June of this year.
