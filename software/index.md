### I Haven't Written This Software!
I maintain [reference functions here in R](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin), and then translate them into Python and C++ in my spare time (aka rarely).

However, I'm afraid I don't truly have the time, skills, or even the interest in creating a useful piece of software. Sorry!

That said, a few individuals *are* working on just that! I will put the best attempts here, although I can't really guarantee that these attempts successfully followed my design.
