### Hub and Spoke

As of February 2015, there are a few teams who have contacted me for help with implementing the Truthcoin protocol. Some [operate openly](http://www.augur.net/) while others requested that I maintain their anonymity.

I offer all of them (and anyone who emails me) free Truthcoin advice. **I do not have an exclusive relationship with any team**, although I have preferences like anyone else.

I look forward to linking to the winning team(s) here (and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/truthcoin)) when they have finished something presentable. Dramatically, each team plans to finish their coding work at around the same time: April-June of this year.
