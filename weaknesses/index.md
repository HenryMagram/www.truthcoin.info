I look forward to filling this section. **Please help by offering your constructive criticism.**  

As of mid-October this page is under construction and not completely reliable.

## Might be a problem

### Voters don't follow Branch Instructions on What Counts as 'Ambiguous'

- The process works best when there is tacit coordination among voters. To make coordination tacit, the scheme encourages voters to slightly dis-coordinate rival voters, given that they are already >50% coordinated with the statistically-representative voter.
- Therefore, voters may lie to each other on how they plan to vote on ambiguity.
- Optionally: Introduce strategic-complexity, like an author-penalty, to encourage tacit '.5' votes.

### Someone ends up secretly owning >Phi of a Branch which becomes "medium-popular", AND waits for an especially crucial Ballot on that Branch, AND Miners are too lazy to veto the result or the Branch itself.

- This scenario can be avoided in a number of ways (Trustworthy (1-Phi) Branch coalition,  Branch insurance, attacked parties rent hashpower), but ultimately this is the major failure case.
- Notably, only the Decisions on this Branch are compromised, all other Decisions are safe, and markets are only contaminated along the dimension of any Decisions they used from the attacked-Branch.
- Also, the entire market cap of the Branch would likely be wiped out, costing the attacker disproportionately (Phi always > .5)
- "Especially crucial Ballots" are discouraged in the Listing Fees, but quite imperfectly (as they are ex ante).
- If the Branch were "very popular", it is far more likely that the Miners would veto.



## Probably Not a Problem

### Miners are too lazy to ever veto anything, making the miner-veto an empty threat.

- More a 'fail-safe' to prevent a blockchain reorg than anything.
- Never exactly an 'empty' threat (always a source of uncertainty for attackers).

### <Phi Voters attack everything at once
- Sitting duck for audit
- - very easy to tell a mistake has been made (entire Ballot is unrealistic)
- - attacker has tied up lots of money (difficult for attacker to game audit)
- - much to gain by auditing correctly

### <Phi Voters attack only a few things at once


### Scalability
- I might be wrong, but I don't see the Truthcoin scalability challenges from being any different from Bitcoin's.
- The vote-matrix is Voter by Decisions, but both are economically constrained. Each Branch creates a new set of Voters, and a new matrix.



## Definitely Not a Problem

### Sybil attacks on Voting
- Votes are weighted by proportional-ownership in an abstraction of a corporation, so Sybil attacks are as unlikely here as one is likely to buy all of the shares of a bank and then attempt to vote to give yourself all of the bank's money.
