There's just so much to do, and as I am fully (and happily) employed, just not enough time to do it.  If you can help with the following, please do so!

Requests:

1. I always need people to, periodically, help me keep the R / Python / C++ versions updated. I always work in R first, then spend some time translating from R to Python / C++. If you can do this instead, that would be very nice.
2. If someone is great at writing unit tests in R / Python / C++, that is also something I'd like to do.
3. I always need individuals to proofread the documentation (and slides, and website and demo etc), for typos but also for clarity. 
4. The more who learn about this project, the better. Wherever there is discussion of a] large-scale information aggregation ("Where is that Malaysian plane?", "Should Bitcoin increase its blocksize?"), b] robust external-data feeds within blockchain ("BitUSD", "Event Derivatives"), or c] "Bitcoin 2.0" / Smart Contracts ("If X, then pay Y."), someone should probably hop in and mention what's being done with this project.
5. I am currently interested in conducting an empirical test of the SVD-resolution process. If you are skilled with Mechanical Turk (or similar), email me. 


Random Notes in Haphazard Order:

1. FAQ Should have Table of Contents section.
2. Will my blog have comments? Can users up or downvote them? Should, instead, I make a 'blog' section on the forum (low quality control though)? Perhaps reddit instead.
4. More help on the Empirical Test.
4. Probably much more...
