There's just so much to do, and as I am fully (and happily) employed, just not enough time to do it.  If you can help with the following, please do so!

Random Notes in Haphazard Order:

1. FAQ Should have Table of Contents section.
2. Will my blog have comments? Can users up or downvote them? Should, instead, I make a 'blog' section on the forum (low quality control though)? Perhaps reddit instead.
3. Individuals to help me proofread.
4. More help on the Empirical Test.
4. Probably much more...
