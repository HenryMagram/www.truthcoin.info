There's just so much to do, and as I am fully (and happily) employed, just not enough time to do it.  If you can help with the following, please do so!

## Requests

### Code

1. I always need people to, periodically, help me keep the R / Python / C++ versions updated. I always work in R first, then spend some time translating from R to Python / C++. If you can do this instead, that would be very nice.
2. If someone is great at writing unit tests in R / Python / C++, that is also something I'd like to do.  

There's been a lot of investor interest, if you are an ultra-qualified developer (at or near the Bitcoin Core Dev Team member level), I can almost certainly get you a job.

### Writing
3. I always need individuals to proofread the documentation (and slides, and website and demo etc), for typos but also for clarity.

### Marketing 
4. The more who learn about this project, the better. Wherever there is discussion of a] large-scale information aggregation ("Where is that Malaysian plane?", "Should Bitcoin increase its blocksize?"), b] robust external-data feeds within blockchain ("BitUSD", "Event Derivatives"), or c] "Bitcoin 2.0" / Smart Contracts ("If X, then pay Y."), someone should probably hop in and mention what's being done with this project.

### Research
5. I'm interested in conducting an empirical test of the SVD-resolution process. If you are skilled with Mechanical Turk (or similar), email me. 

### Small Tasks

1. FAQ Should have Table of Contents section, and links (must I use Github's source for this?)
2. I'm not sure this is the best style for this (jekyll) blog. Let me know if you think of a better one.
3. It would appear that I can't figure out how to centrally-align images in this blog ( `<img ... align="middle">` did not work). Maybe it is the jekyll theme.
